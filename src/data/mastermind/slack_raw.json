I believe it would entail valuable synergies to gather inquisitive individuals from different professions and create appropriate settings in which they can share knowledge.\n\nAre we then sure that the written format is the best for such a form of discussion? There’s lots of talks/debates online where professionals in various positions discuss things from physics, to politics, and so forth. \n\n&gt;Another element, which is rather unique to this platform, is segmentation.

How come we almost never see these mechanisms online?\n\nWell, as someone who is already a part of several invite-only groups, I think we do see it online, it’s just not advertised, because of the same reason you listed; namely that they use appropriate filters that only makes the target audience pursue the goal of enrolment, so to speak, in the first place. So to that end, I think it’s a fine idea, and it’s something that is already being used through various channels. \n\n&gt; For that reason, I think it would be interesting to see dialogues where an actual conclusion is not necessarily needed. Perhaps philosophical questions might be too difficult to discuss since they apparently can only be understood on a level beyond thoughts. However, I believe that that assertion would constitute a very good foundation for a constructive discussion. I am confident that discussions would emerge naturally when curious people are gathered. \n\nI certainly agree. Oh, and just because self-realization and true sanity cannot happen within an obstructed thinking consciousness (perhaps see the recent video I posted on <#C0F20Q1QE> to get a grasp on what I mean by that), that doesn’t mean that the pursuit of philosophy shouldn’t be encouraged, because as the Ancients used to say, Philosophy is by its very nature the search for Truth. However, what the Ancients realized, and what contemporary philosophers are unfortunately not, is that the without going beyond the fetters of the ego, there can be no clear vision of what truth entails. So, yes to that end, moving from a state of opinion (doxia) to knowledge (gnosis) would be very difficult without proper guidance. \n\n&gt; I am very fascinated by the constellation of Etisk Råd.

As a side note, why would it being Danish be a problem for me? You think I forgot how to read Danish after reading too much English? :stuck_out_tongue: \n\nOverall, I think it’s a great idea if one could find a proper outlet for it — as you say, we need a design that could tailor to the format of discussion you wish to cultivate within the borders of the Site.

Very interesting and challenging questions. Questions containing elements that I have not thought about.\nFirstly, I would like to stress the fact that this idea is not something revolutionary - neither with respect to setup or technology (at least not initially). In my opinion, it is more an incremental improvement of existing solutions, which I genuinely believe is necessary. It is therefore difficult to emphasise elements that explicitly differentiate the platform from existing platforms. However, I believe that the platforms you mentioned have two profound drawbacks in addition to their visually unattractive and uninteresting appearance, which this idea might be able to comply with.\nThe fact that these platforms are centred around specific topics might seem convenient. However, personally I would hate to switch between different websites depending on which topic I would like to discuss. Moreover, I am not fond of blindly delimiting subjects from eachother this dramatically since I believe that they are somehow interrelated, which takes me to my second point. One of the absolute core values of this idea is that by gathering numerous topics we obtain the potential of accumulating knowledge from different areas. Knowledge that should be distributed through different channels. In my opinion, the most valuable discussion appear when you are introduced to perspectives that you had not considered. A discussion between politicians might be interesting. However, it would probably become more interesting if experts from other professions contributed to the pool of knowledge.

How come we almost never see these mechanisms online?\nHonestly, I have not really thought about the format of the potential dialogues. I just do not see a need for another encyclopaedia, where factual questions can be answered without any form of actual dialogue. For that reason, I think it would be interesting to see dialogues where an actual conclusion is not necessarily needed. Perhaps philosophical questions might be too difficult to discuss since they apparently can only be understood on a level beyond thoughts.

Glad to see you around here!\n\nWell, my immediate reaction would be: Isn’t that what forums are for? I know forums in neuroscience/mind-stuff, like <http://brainmeta.com/forum/>, I know forums for politics, like <http://www.politicalforum.com/> &amp; <http://www.debatepolitics.com/>, I know forums for economics and so on and so forth. My question would be, how is your platform different than a simple forum setup?\n\nMy next question would be related to your notion of intellectual debate. For instance, according to Socratic dialogue, dialectic reasoning would be the only way of truly coming to actual conclusions and proper discussions about various subjects (see e.g.  Alcibiades) — what format for dialogue would you use? Would you use an expert panel that would start the conversation, and then let “lay” subscribers interact with said experts in selected areas? \n\nSince you mentioned ethical and philosophical questions, I’d then also perhaps say that things like that are difficult to discuss, maybe not because there’s not a truth, but perhaps because that Truth can only be understood above the level of thoughts. Here I am particularly talking about a higher level of consciousness that actually has insight into why certain actions give certain outcomes, that cannot immediately be gauged by logic. \n\nOf course, a platform that delves into these things would be great, but I am afraid that it would require a very select target group of writers, because without people that can properly construct arguments and structures of logical thought, it would be difficult to start a conversation on such difficult topics without it eventually going into a circle-jerk (to use modern nomenclature) or rhetorical nonsense. \n\nJust some food for thought.","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1454509910.000000"},"ts":"1454509900.000004"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F23JM99","text":"Naturally, there are numerous unanswered questions.

I was sitting at my desk studying something totally irrelevant. For that reason, I did something that almost everybody does nowadays. I found my smartphone and opened Facebook. After browsing my news feed for a few minutes I found an unusually interesting article. The topic of the article is insignificant for now, however, after reading the article l had a profound need to articulate my position on the topic. I read the comments and what I found was that almost all of the comments were either frivolous or out of rhetorical reach. Only very few comments contained rational and deliberate arguments. Therefore, I did not leave a comment. As I see it, it would have been totally useless anyway. Afterwards, I started to think about the experience. \nI opened Slack, which to me is a highly effective communicational tool. However, it has a serious drawback. The communication almost exclusively takes place in pre-existing networks, which in most cases dramatically limits the diversity of the communication. One could argue that it is the opposite deficiency of the one that I experienced on Facebook. \nSubsequently, I did some research on intellectual fora. With the help of my brother, I found numerous interesting platforms (e.g. Medium and Quora) that I had never heard of before. Many of them approached difficult and complex topics, which I found very interesting. The tone was polite and professional and it was genuinely a satisfying experience. However, what I found was that the objectives of these platforms were to answer questions rather than spark discussions. Furthermore, the quality of their content gradually degrades as they become more commercial.\nToday, passionate debates and academic conversations are gradually replaced by digital information gathering and fact collection. Nevertheless, ethic issues and philosophical questions still exist. What would you think of an online platform that encourages intellectual debate about subjects that can not be answered by search engines and encyclopaedias? A platform driven by curious audience where everything from literature and ethics to economics and politics are discussed? The platform should be targeted exclusively towards inquisitive individuals that are able to contribute constructively. The objective is to create an “universe” of knowledge based upon interactive dialogue rather than the partial monologue that characterises the media of today.","ts":"1454508338.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"Ohh yeah, btw I don’t have the slightest idea of how to utilize the idea I wrote about, technically :stuck_out_tongue: Whether iOS or Android allow apps to consume that much CPU, bandwith, memory, etc.","ts":"1454411615.000005"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"I was thinking more about the logistic setup of the business from the customers perspective :simple_smile: Seems like a really good idea.

Here’s quoting from an article I was reading: \n\n\"If stocks are so crazy, how can I make money off of them?\nBecause in the LONG run, it turns out that all this speculation and volatility always cancels out to absolutely zero. The value of stocks will go up as the earnings of the underlying companies goes up.  A portion of the ongoing earnings will always flow to the shareholders as dividends.  And all this happens because of the natural ingenuity of  hardworking humans making things at a profit, and continuing to advance our knowledge and technology and make us all more productive in every field . There may come a time when we can no longer advance, but based on the fact that we’re still driving around in gas-burning tanks and Home Depot is still doing all of its computing on green-on-black mainframe computers that kick you back to the beginning of the order if you make a typing mistake, I’d say we have at least a lifetime left to go in this department.\n\nSo, stocks go up and pay dividends over time, and they have since the beginning of modern commerce. The total return has averaged a very lumpy but fairly dependable 10 percent per year before inflation, 7 percent after inflation. 5 of the 7 percent comes in the form of rising stock prices, and the other 2 comes from dividend payments directly from the company to you. When you’re in your ‘Stashing stage, you just let these dividends automatically reinvest in more stocks which creates a nice compounding effect.\"\n\n“This is the easy part. You buy ALL of them. The world’s smartest people have done incredible studies on this for over 40 years. What they find is that the best way to make money in the stock market is to simply buy an “index fund”, which is a mutual fund that automatically buys appropriate ratios of every major stock in your country’s stock market, with no magic and guessing of which stocks are better than others.\n\nThe reason the index fund wins statistically is because it can be run by a simple automated set of rules – no need to pay $350M salaries to the hotshot traders running the “Aggressive growth fund” down the street. Because there are millions of people, both smart and dumb, squabbling over the value of each stock, the Index Fund benefits and suffers from all the individual stock performances. But overall, you get the average performance of all this squabbling.\n\nIf you descend into the pit and try some squabbling yourself, you may come out ahead or drastically behind the average, but as it turns out, you can’t predict in advance which squabblers (including yourself) will win and which will lose. All you can predict is that your average performance if you buy enough of these funds will be equal to the return of the market as a whole, minus the amount of fees your mutual fund charges. So by picking the index fund with the lowest fees, you automatically win. Endless statistical analysis proves this again and again. If you don’t believe me, read the book “A Random Walk Down Wall Street, or look up the topic of John Bogle / Bogleheads / and the foundation of the Vanguard company itself.\"","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1449782395.000000"},"ts":"1449782360.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"Since we have <@U0F2WABLM> on board, I thought it would be a good idea with a finance channel for discussions. :simple_smile:","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448977081.000000"},"ts":"1448977070.000009","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U0F2WABLM"],"count":1}]},{"user":"U0F23JM99","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F23JM99|andrew> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977010.000008"},{"user":"U0F21G8VD","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000007"},{"user":"U0F570U57","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000006"},{"user":"U0F1V9D9A","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F1V9D9A|rasmus> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000005"},{"user":"U0F1ZMA72","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000004"},{"user":"U0F2WABLM","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F2WABLM|sorenschmidt> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000003"},{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977008.000002"}]},{"id":"C0F1ZM21G","name":"general","is_channel":true,"created":1448093508,"creator":"U0F1ZMA72","is_archived":false,"is_general":true,"is_member":true,"members":["U0F1V9D9A","U0F1WH8AZ","U0F1ZMA72","U0F21G8VD","U0F23JM99","U0F2WABLM","U0F570U57","U0KL1MXC5"],"topic":{"value":"Company-wide announcements and work-based matters","creator":"","last_set":0},"purpose":{"value":"This channel is for team-wide communication and announcements.

The requirements of being a medical student are mostly just memorization of countless amounts of details about the human body, and being able to freehand write with no reference tools any question pertaining to that particular subject being studied.  As you can perhaps gauge from my tone, I somewhat disagree with the way we are being taught. In Southern University of Denmark, where I study, the courses are divided into specific core Modules, pertaining to one area / purpose of the body. Just to give you an idea, currently, for instance, I am studying a module called _Homeostasis_, with its main focus being on the kidneys as they are somewhat notorious for managing body fluid volume and keeping the body balanced in more ways than one, through homeostatic regulations. \n\n_Powers_: I’ve always been insanely curious and experimental about consciousness and life in general. I’ve always wanted to find hacks and tweaks to my life, and _unlock_ my self, so to speak. I’ve realized however, that while wanting to do that and dreaming about it is fine and dandy, it’s not without its sacrifices and determination that it can actually happen. As for actual \"powers\", I'm a serious meditator, mystic, and life-hacker, so for anyone interested in those pursuits, I am sure I will be able to at least be a guiding post, pushing any of you in the right direction of your own self-exploration. I also have a keen understanding of the holistic way the human body works, and I've spent many hours investigating and studying nootropics, herbs and various pharmaceuticals for life-hack purposes, so if anyone are interested in those aspects, I will be able to help there as well. \n\n_Passion_: Ever since I was a kid, I noticed that there was something quite different in my perspective of life compared to most others. I felt that there was something beneath the surface of what was going on all around me, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. It felt like a big charade; a game, an illusion. My psychedelic and spiritual adventures showed me personally that I was correct. There is far more to reality than this mere concrete physical reality that we can immediately and readily see and sense through our sense-impressions. Luckily, I am not the only one of this belief. Modern physics and Quantum Physics in particular is shedding more light on this illusion that is physicality. To those that are interested in this aspect of physical reality, I can heartily recommend the book _The Holographic Universe_ by Michael Talbot. I may talk about this more in <#C0F20Q1QE>, when the time is right. \n\n_Purpose_: I believe my purpose has always been to share wisdom, insight and generally love and compassion toward all people. My interest in becoming a doctor has actually always been secondary to seeking a form of deep healing for not only myself but all of mankind. The great old physician and psychiatrist Carl G. Jung used to have a saying, _“Only a wounded doctor can hope to heal”_\n\nWell, to my eyes, it is quite clear in this day and age, a lot of people are walking around wounded and in delusion of their true nature. In my opinion, it is not without sacrifice and delving into the recesses of the mind that the truth of the matter is found and the ultimate help, be given.","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448355095.000000"},"ts":"1448352814.000004"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"Lets get to it.

It may give a bit more oomph to the transformation. Obsession used productively is a great thing. \n\nIn NLP and spiritual transformational systems, we use something similar that’s called auto-suggestion. Before sleep, every night, you choose a particular idea you would like to impress upon your unconscious systems. It could, “I am healthy”, or “I am happy”, or “I accomplish my goals”, and you repeat that phrase 40 repetitions at least before you fall asleep. You do this every night, and when you wake up in the morning, you start your day with that. As you find the impregnation being succesful, you can then change it to something else, but give it at least a month or so for obvious changes to occur. This goes very well with meditation because it allows the link between conscious and unconscious mind to increase. More energy will be readily available. If you have questions regarding auto-suggestion, don’t hesitate to ask. I will make a full post on it, should it be wanted/desired.","attachments":[{"service_name":"reddit","title":"[Method] A Goal-Setting Fix That Will Transform Your Life—That You'll Find Nowhere Else [X-Post r/LifeHacks] • /r/getdisciplined","title_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/33jijb/method_a_goalsetting_fix_that_will_transform_your/","text":"Do you obsessively want to accomplish your goals?

The spring is when the earth receives its new influx of energy from the sun, and this equinox is the ideal time to bring in the new year with spiritual celebration and inspiration. Specifically, it is a time marked by a certain phase of the moon following the spring equinox, for all magical calendars must take into account both the sun and the moon. All four seasonal intervals are a good time for fire rituals: the fire rituals in winter are to support the kalva (time of retreat) and the burning of obstacles, and the fire ritual of the spring equinox is to support the prayers and new years resolutions made on that day, similar to how old traditions might sacrifice an animal before a grand voyage”_","ts":"1451740980.000007"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"<!channel>:","ts":"1451740937.000006"},{"user":"U0F570U57","inviter":"U0F1ZMA72","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1451740897.000005"},{"user":"U0F21G8VD","inviter":"U0F1ZMA72","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1451740897.000004"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"I hope everyone started 2016 on a highnote and are ready to the challenges and lessons to come.

Doshas are energies that are found throughout the the human body and mind. Similarly to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), each of the three doshas reflect elements. \n\n- Vata: *Ether and Air.* \n\nSome of its qualities: Dry, Light, Cold, Rough, Subtle, Mobile, Clear. \n\n- Pitta: *Fire and Water.* \n\nSome of its qualities: Oily, Sharp, Hot, Light, Mobile, Liquid. \n\n- Kapha: *Earth and Water*. \n\nSome of its qualities: Heavy, Slow, Cold, Oily, Slimy (smooth), Dense, Soft, Static (stable), Cloudy (sticky). \n\nSo in the Ayurvedic system, a person with a constitution of Vata has physical qualities that correspond to the Ether and the Air element. This will usually be reflected as: thin build, quick thinking, fast moving, hard to gain weight, low Agni (digestive fire) with low or irregular appetite and digestion, tendency to constipation and gas, emotional affective state leaning toward anxiety and fear, personality leaning towards vivacious, talkative, social and outgoing. \n\nA person with the Pitta constitution will have qualities reflective of Fire and Water elements, so here one will observe things like a fiery personality, high Agni (digestive fire) and quick digestion, oily skin, medium build, can gain weight but also lose weight equally easy, personality leaning towards being in control, intense, ambitious, and the negative affective state leaning toward jealousy and anger. \n\nA person with the Kapha constitution will have qualities reflective of Earth and Water elements, so here one will observe solid body frame, calm temperament, gains weight easily and hard to lose, slow digestion, personality leaning towards reserved, laid back, concerned, and negative affective state leaning toward posessive, greedy and withdrawn. \n\nWhile there is often one dosha in predominance according to this system based on bodily constitution, most people have a second dosha with strong influence. They refer to this as a dual-doshic constitution. \n\nSo for people still struggling with health and looking to optimize their health to their best ability and thus also increase their ability in meditation, I suggest taking a test such as <http://www.naturesformulary.com/contents/dosha-test> one and see if you have an excess of one of the doshas. If you do, I suggest trying a pacifying diet that corresponds to that dosha, and see if your health improves. \n\nI hope this post was helpful to some of you.","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1457686838.000000"},"ts":"1457686770.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"Yeah, I know how you feel mate","ts":"1456090186.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"I’m kinda pissed to be honest!

Because of that, it can also lead to severe ramifications down the line in terms of cancerous growths, and various other destabilizations of internal cellular machinery. There’s the unfortunate case where doctors in the 40-70s prescribed artificial Estrogen to postmenopausal women, and the ramifications were an increased incidence of breast cancer and thus overall mortality. This was of course not expected, but was found out, after-the-fact. \n\nCurrently, there’s not just the problem of GMO, but also artificial sugars, countless carnicogens and lots of toxic substances that are added to most of the food we can buy today because of the increased use of pesticides and various toxic chemicals to increase the crop size.","attachments":[{"text":"Healing With Whole Foods: Asian Traditions and Modern Nutrition (3rd Edition) [Paul Pitchford] on <http://Amazon.com|Amazon.com>. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.

You really can’t go wrong with those sorts of basics. \n\nFor immune health, if you’re worried about coming down with flu or the common cold, I can recommend EpiCor, which is a scientifically validated prebiotic that increases immune system activity. Besides that, the mushroom called Reishi Mushroom is extremely effective at improving general health and immune system activity. I’d personally be taking it daily if it wasn’t so expensive. \n\nIf you’re more interested in muscular and athletic performance stuff, then stuff like BCAAs, Beta-Alanine, Creatine and D-Aspartic Acid will do you much good. \n\nFor manly health, testosterone levels and related, I’ve heard some people have good results from Maca and cycling Tongkat Ali. \n\nFor cognitive performance - I thought I might as well mention it - lots of people love the L-Theanine/Caffeine combination, so if you’re already a coffee drinker, you may want to take a look into that. L-Theanine is the active component of Green Tea, and has a balancing effects on brain waves, increasing the alpha-waves in particular, which are associated with heightened mindfulness and relaxation. In a 2:1 ratio (200mg L-Theanine, 100mg caffeine), studies have found an improved response in terms of cognitive performance. If you wish, I can share you those studies, if it’s something you want to pursue. \n\nSo, it really depends on your temperament, your goals, and ultimately, your desire for experimentation. \n\nDiet, exercise and a good amount of sleep will go a _long_ way, but when you have that in order, adding a few supplements here and there can really help your body perform at its optimum level (which is really just its natural level..). \n\nHope that helped! :simple_smile:","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448980452.000000"},"ts":"1448979685.000006"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F2WABLM","text":"Anders/Mark: What would you recommend as a starter kit, due to supplements?","ts":"1448979242.000005"},{"user":"U0F21G8VD","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977288.000004"},{"user":"U0F570U57","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977279.000003"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"Interesting.

Link: <http://deltabed.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jording_og_helse.pdf>\n\n*Conclusion:* _De Flora et al. wrote the following: “Since the late 20th century, chronic degenerative diseases have overcome infectious disease as the major causes of death in the 21st century, so an increase in human longevity will depend on finding an intervention that inhibits the development of these diseases and slows their progress”_\n\n_Could such an intervention be located right beneath our feet? Earthing research, observations, and related theories raise an intriguing possibility about the Earth’s surface electrons as an untapped health resource—the Earth as a “global treatment table.” Emerging evidence shows that contact with the Earth—whether being outside barefoot or indoors connected to grounded conductive systems—may be a simple, natural, and yet profoundly effective environmental strategy against chronic stress, ANS dysfunction, inflammation, pain, poor sleep, disturbed HRV, hypercoagulable blood, and many common health disorders, including cardiovascular disease. The research done to date supports the concept that grounding or earthing the human body may be an essential element in the health equation along with sunshine, clean air and water, nutritious food, and physical activity._ \n\n——— \n\nI find this topic absolutely fascinating, because it is such a simple solution, yet profound effects are found from it. We’ve found that a lot of day to day modern lifestyle diseases come from simply being _too_ stressed out. Well, they’ve found out that the Earth actually protects you from that sort of thing, by forcing your body to activate more of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) activation instead of going amok in the sympathetic nervous system.  \n\nQuoting from relevant study under 2.4.1: _“The immediate decrease in SC indicates a rapid activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and corresponding deactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The immediate increase in SC at cessation of grounding indicates an opposite effect. Increased RR, stabilization of BO, and slight rise in heart rate suggest the start of a metabolic healing response necessitating an increase in oxygen consumption.”_\n\nSimply said: *awesome.* \n\nI should receive an Earthing device shortly, so I will most likely report back after a couple of week’s usage.","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448892953.000000"},"ts":"1448892850.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"What a fascinating reported study.

You can imagine emotions like very dense thoughts; emotions usually accompany thoughts, or thoughts accompany emotions. You simply notice and see that these emotions are there.

This is not surprising since most common meditators and Yoga practitioners have completely misinterpreted the teachings. Therefore it’s paramount to understand this, even before one begins meditating. \n\n1. Meditation is _not_ about *suppressing* thoughts! When one is doing breathing meditation, and pays attention to the breath, one should _not_ disregard other things that come to mind. As they appear, one should realize that the same “knowing nature” is observing these things as they come and go in front of the awareness. \n\n2. The second mistake is to sit in torpor (a form of laziness of the mind), losing mindfulness (the strength of the “knowing nature”) and one follows the thought wherever it goes, as if one has fallen asleep, later to snap awake. \n\nIn both of these ways, one has fallen prey to torpor

In other words, the sacred manifests itself in physical form. \n3. Because all matter is made frmo the sacred, all things posssess a soul, a sacred intelligence, or _logos_. \n4. Because human beings are generated out of this same substance, it is possible for human beings to communicate with the soul or intelligence in all other matter and for those intelligences to communicate with human beings. \n5. Human beings were ignorant when they arrived here, and the powers of the Earth and the various intelligences in all things began to teach them how to be human. This is still true. It is not possible for new generations to become human without this communication or reatching from the natural world. \n6. Parts of the Earth can manifest more or less sacredness, just like human beings. A human being can never know when some part of the Earth might be expressing deep levels of sacredness or begin talking to him or here. Therefore, it is important to cultivate attentiveness of mind. \n7. Human beings are only one of the many life-forms of the Earth, neither more nor less important than the others.

Tobacco, for ancient peoples, was considered a holy plant, a plant with great spiritual powers, whose purpose was to facilitate communication between human beings and the sacred powers of the Earth and the Universe. This same dynamic, the splitting apart of the body and the spirit of a thing, has occurred with a great many other things that have always been considered intrinsically spiritual in nature. Fasting is one of them. \n\nFor the past five hundred years the trend has been, increasingly, to view matter as devoid of spirit, intelligence, soul, or purpose. A lump of rock — merely inanimate matter, a resource or something on which to stub your toe, certainly not something filled with soul. But throughout human history, human cultural perspectives about such things have been very different. In earlier times, it was commonly understood, irrespective of culture or historical period, that the world was alive, that all things possessed souls, that human beings were only one of a multitude of ensouled beings, and that there was a constant soul energy going out of and into our bodies as we traveled through the world. Beyond any health aspects it was known to posess, fasting, like tobacco, was one way, an important way, to deepen communication with the sacred. Fasting, it was recognized, increased human sensitivity to the nonmaterial world, enhanced personal experience of the sacredness of both self and Universe, and helped the fasting person regain a sense of orientation and purpose. \n\nCompared to the mechanistic worldview that is now so dominant, oler perspectives of the Universe are much more complex and multidimensional. Ancient and nonindustrial cultures understood that the Universe and the Earth were deeply sacred. Human beings, along with all other life-forms, are, within those earlier perspectives, considered to be inextricably embedded in this sacred world, indeed to be an integral part of it. These ancient viewpoints are not _beliefs_ as we now understand the term but are representative of a living experience.

Thereby a pool of immature neurons is generated that are potentially recruitable by subsequent cognitive stimuli. Along these lines, we here tested whether auditory stimuli might exert a similar non-specific effect on adult neurogenesis in mice. We used the standard noise level in the animal facility as baseline and compared this condition to white noise, pup calls, and silence. In addition, as patterned auditory stimulus without ethological relevance to mice we used piano music by Mozart (KV 448). All stimuli were transposed to the frequency range of C57BL/6 and hearing was objectified with acoustic evoked potentials. We found that except for white noise all stimuli, including silence, increased precursor cell proliferation (assessed 24 h after labeling with bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU). This could be explained by significant increases in BrdU-labeled Sox2-positive cells (type-1/2a). But after 7 days, only silence remained associated with increased numbers of BrdU-labeled cells. Compared to controls at this stage, exposure to silence had generated significantly increased numbers of BrdU/NeuN-labeled neurons.  _Our results indicate that the unnatural absence of auditory input as well as spectrotemporally rich albeit ethological irrelevant stimuli activate precursor cells-in the case of silence also leading to greater numbers of newborn immature neurons-whereas ambient and unstructured background auditory stimuli do not_“\n\nTL:DR: “Silence is better than auditory input for the growth of new brain cels.\"","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1452109657.000000"},"ts":"1452109595.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":":innocent:","ts":"1449513133.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"As Lao Tzu said, so elegantly, \n\n“If there is right in the soul, \nThere will be beauty in the person, \nIf there is beauty in the person, \nThere will be harmony in the person, \nIf there is harmony in the home, \nThere will be order in the nation, \nIf there is order in the nation,\nThere will be peace in the world.”\n\nStart today.

There sits the meditator parked on his little cushion. Is he out giving blood? No. Is he busy working with disaster victims? No. But let us examine his motivation. Why is he doing this? His intention is to purge his own of anger, prejudice and ill-will. He is actively engaged in the process of getting rid of greed, tension and insensitivity. Those are the very items which obstruct his compassion for others. \n\nUntil they are gone, any good works that he does are likely to be just an extension of his own ego and of no real help in the long run. Harm in the name of help is one of the oldest games. The grand inquistor of the Spanish Inquistion spouts the lofties of motives. The Salem witchcraft trials were conducted for the public good. Examine the personal lives of advanced meditators and you will often find them engaged in humaniatiran service. You will seldom find them as crusading missionaries who are willing to sacrifice certain individuals for the sake of some pious idea. The fact is we are more selfish than we know. The ego has a way of turning the lofties of activites into trash if it is allowed free range. Through meditation we become aware of ourselves exactly as we are, by waking up to the numerous subtle ways that we manifest our own selfishness. Then we truly begin to be genuinely selfless. Cleansing yourself of selfishness is not a selfish activity. \n\n_Meditation is running away from reality_\n\nIncorrect. Meditation is running into reality. It does not insulate you from the pain of life. It allows you to delve so deeply into life and all its aspects that you pierce the pain barrier and you go beyond suffering. Vipassana is a practice done with the specific intention of facing reality, to fully experience life just as it is and to cope with exactly what you find. It allows you to blow aside the illusions and to free yourself from all those polite little lies you tell yourself all the time. What is there is there. You are who you are, and lying to yourself about your own weaknesses and motivations only binds you tighter on the wheel of illusion. Vipassana meditation is not an attempt to forget yourself or cover up your troubles. It is learning to look at yourself exactly as you are. See what is there, accept it fully. Only then can you change it. \n\nExcerpts taken from: *Mindfulness in Plain English written by Venerable H.

The idea was to demonstrate to his students the effects of long-term meditation. Curious to see if there was a difference, John agreed. After his EEG was recorded—and yes, his brain activity was unusual—the meditator asked about the lab’s research. John told him about our work on the neural basis of insight, and he was intrigued. There was some time left in the session, so John asked him if he wanted to do a series of remote associates problems. He enthusiastically agreed. John was sure that the meditator would blow these problems away. After all, he had a superbly honed mind and a doctorate to boot. However, after he attempted about a dozen problems, it looked like he was going to tank. He timed out on puzzle after puzzle without solving a single one. After watching a couple of dozen painful failures, John was about to stop the session to spare the Zen meditator further embarrassment. But then he got one right. And then another and another. From that point on, he got nearly all of them right. This was unprecedented. Over the years, we have tested hundreds of participants and found no evidence that practice during a single session improves performance on remote associates problems. Nevertheless, the Zen meditator showed an amazing—and very sudden—improvement in his performance. This was an informal observation rather than a formal experiment, so we can’t offer a definitive explanation for the meditator’s turnaround. We do, however, have an educated hypothesis. Years of intensive meditation may have granted our Zen subject with hyper-refined attention. His mind was so still, focused, and concentrated that associations didn’t spontaneously pop into his awareness. However, his years of mental training also afforded him a great deal of self-control. Failing to solve these problems within his regular state of mind, he had the ability to try out different ways of allocating his attention until he hit on the broad focus that optimized his performance. Once he found the right spread of attention, his superior self-control allowed him to maintain it consistently, resulting in outstanding performance._\n\nAnd why don’t you check out <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150827083659.htm> &amp; <http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150730130729.htm> while you’re at it.

That is often the case when it comes to that sort of thing. Without practical experience, all those words and descriptions will always just be like a finger pointing to the moon, but never the moon itself. _C’est ne pas un pipe_. \n\nTherefore, I think the best thing to move this forward, is simply to introduce a beginner technique. I’ve written this sort of beginner guide to several people — so please do try it out, if just for 5 minutes every day (though I recommend at least 10-30 minutes daily) for a week, and come back and tell me how it went or how it was terrible and there’s no point to it all! Any sort of feedback is appreciated. \n\nThere are many different techniques of meditation one can use, but they all come down to one thing: _stilling_ the mind. What does stilling the mind mean exactly? \n\nWell, consider a glass of muddy water. When you first look at this water, you’ll think, well… this is not going anywhere — but as you continue watching, the mud slowly descends to the ground in the glass, and what’s left? A clear glass of water. In this metaphor, your thoughts and emotional turmoil is like all this mud. By just watching this mud for extended periods of time, in complete silence, the mud starts to clear out, and we’re left with what’s called by the Taoists _10000 miles of clear sky_, a state of utterly clear awareness where we are fully present and alive, blissful in the moment. Please keep this metaphor in mind when you meditate. \n\nSo, when you are new to meditation, you simply need to work on calming your mind, which involves developing a one-pointed attention and relaxation. I suggest you start with 10 minutes, but at least twice daily (if you are to see significant results). Slowly increase the length to 12, then 14, then 16 minutes and so forth. You are not actually meditating at that point, but simply improving your capacity to do so. \n\nDuring this period of time, do your best focusing on the breath. How does one focus on the breath? One simply notes internally that the breath is moving in, it stops for a while, then it moves out, stops for a while, then moves in again. By continuously focusing on the breath (being aware of it), the thoughts will rest and eventually settle. The mind becomes more clear, and that's the point where true meditation begins. \n\nFrustration has no place in meditation practice, so you should always treat your mind with calmness. When you are distracted away from the breath, remember that you cannot remove thoughts. Just witness them and realize your distraction and move your awareness back to the breath. Tell your mind “thank you for letting me know of my distraction, so that I may return to the breath.” The thoughts will fade away naturally. \n\nSome people misunderstand how to focus or be aware of the breath and think that they ought to struggle. This is not the case. A metaphor that helps here is like holding jelly in your hand. Do not squish too tight, lest it is lost. Do not hold too freely either, because then it is also lost. Attend to the breath like you attend to a loved one. \n\nConsider that, after all, your breath keeps you alive. Ought you not to appreciate it fully with attention? When you realize the profundity of the breath, it helps with the awareness and one-pointed attention on it. \n\nThis is one of the greatest beginner techniques for developing a calm mind, and was recommend by Siddharta Gautama as a method that can bring one directly toward enlightenment, through all 8 samadhis by correctly following the breath — so do not think it is not an advanced technique: in some of the most simplest of solutions, the most advanced of experiences can be attained. \n\nBest of luck. Please report back if you do go ahead and try it. As we move along in time, I will share more.","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1449005321.000000"},"ts":"1449005164.000004"},{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","topic":"Meditation","type":"message","subtype":"channel_topic","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: Meditation","ts":"1449004409.000003"},{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","topic":"What is self-realization?","type":"message","subtype":"channel_topic","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: What is self-realization?","ts":"1449002747.000002"},{"user":"U0F21G8VD","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977315.000003"},{"user":"U0F570U57","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977308.000002"},{"user":"U0F2WABLM","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F2WABLM|sorenschmidt> has joined the channel","ts":"1448319804.000002"},{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","topic":"Introduction to Meditaton","type":"message","subtype":"channel_topic","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: Introduction to Meditaton","ts":"1448125830.000003"},{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","topic":"Meditation introduction","type":"message","subtype":"channel_topic","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: Meditation introduction","ts":"1448125814.000002"},{"user":"U0F23JM99","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F23JM99|andrew> has joined the channel","ts":"1448119746.000002"},{"user":"U0F1V9D9A","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","text":"<@U0F1V9D9A|rasmus> has joined the channel","ts":"1448105282.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"To start off with, those that may not know much about meditation, let's distill it into its main components and talk a bit about it.

A regular sitting practice has been shown, scientifically mind you, to enhance focus and concentration, lower blood pressure, improve sleep quality. It’s been used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Meditation allows the practictioner to gain insight into their personalities, relationships, behaviors, and makes it easier to reverse past conditioning by increasing overall awareness and sensitivity. The enhanced awareness is enormously helpful in work and personal relationships, as it adds depth to one’s interactions with others. The emotional stability that comes from the calming and relaxation effects of meditation need also be mentioned. All of these effects, however, are just side-benefits, or if you will, side-effects of meditation. \n\nFully developed meditational ability gives rise to increasingly wonderful sensations and mental states characterized by deep mental and physical relaxation, inner joy, peace, happiness and profound inner peace. These are states that open the mind to an intuitive grasp of the interconnectedness of all that is and dispels the illusion of separateness told and created by the ego. \n\nHowever, even those peak states of meditation are not the ultimate goal or benefit from meditation. While bliss, joy and tranquility are all very real and enticing, it can often be interrupted by sickness, difficult life circumstances and other influences. It also offers no protection from the difficulties of averting the draw toward lust, greed, aversion and sloth. They are simply a means to a higher goal. That goal, of course, is _awakening_. \n\nInstead of awakening, words one might use can be, _self-realization_ and _enlightenment_ . Each of these words simply refers to a cognitive event that brings lasting freedom from suffering where one is unaffected by aging, disease or mere circumstance. It is not some transient experience of divine unity and dissolution of the ego. No, rather, it’s the attainment of true genuine wisdom (by the traditions called prajna wisdom) that comes from profound realization and opening one’s eyes to the ultimate truth, which is the the only true and worthy goal of any spiritual tradition. \n\nA mind with this type of prajna wisdom experiences life and death as a great adventure, with the clear purpose of manifesting compassion, peace, and love toward all beings.","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448102549.000000"},"ts":"1448102444.000008","reactions":[{"name":"thinking_face","users":["U0F1ZMA72"],"count":1}]},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"Welcome everyone.

The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will, before it sees the shadow of the whip; the second best will run as well as the first one, just before the whip reaches its skin; the third one will run when it feels pain on its body; the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn to run._\n\n_\"When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. But this is a mistake\", Master Suzuki says. When you learn too easily, you're tempted not to work hard, not to penetrate to the marrow of a practice._\n\n_\"If you study calligraphy, you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art, and in life.\" The best horse, according to Suzuki, may be the worst horse. And the worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever it is practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones._\n\n_\"Suzuki's parable of the four horses has haunted me ever since I first heard it. For one thing, it poses a clear challenge for the person with exceptional tal- ent: to achieve his or her full potential, this person will have to work just as diligently as those with less innate ability”_\n\n- Mastery\n\nAn excerpt from the book.

Kittlaus called on Viv to pay a buddy $20 and all that followed was a tap of the pay button through a Venmo integration and,&amp;nbsp;all of a sudden,&amp;nbsp;his friend had been paid.\nIndeed, Kittlaus specified that&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;perfecting the third-party ecosystem&amp;rdquo; will&amp;nbsp;be critical to the soul of their mission. Kittlaus said that Viv would one day become a &amp;ldquo;primary source&amp;rdquo; for users.\nA clear&amp;nbsp;strength of the Viv platform was the &amp;ldquo;stackability&amp;rdquo; of inquiries. As opposed to short-term-memoried platforms like Siri, Viv was able to embrace follow-up questions without stuttering or gasping for context that was just said seconds before.\nIn an interview onstage with TechCrunch Editor-in-Chief Matthew Panzarino, Viv CEO Dag Kittlaus discussed what differentiated this assistant from the dozens of others.\nKittlaus detailed the real secret sauce of Viv was something called &amp;ldquo;dynamic program generation,&amp;rdquo; which allows the AI-powered assistant to understand intent and generate a program itself to best answer the query.\n&amp;ldquo;Instead of having to write every code instructed, you&amp;rsquo;re really just describing what you want it to do,&amp;rdquo; said Kittlaus.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The whole idea of Viv is that developers can go in and build any experience that they want.&amp;rdquo;\nThroughout the demo, mental comparisons to Siri were inevitable.&amp;nbsp;What was initially hailed as a massive advance has grown a bit more maligned in recent years as complaints have piled on that Siri&amp;rsquo;s accuracy isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to be relied on.\nAll of this is particularly interesting because Kittlaus co-founded Siri in 2007 after spinning the underlying technologies out of the Stanford Research Institute. He initially saw a future for&amp;nbsp;Siri&amp;nbsp;that looked quite&amp;nbsp;similar to what he has envisioned for Viv. Though his company supported nearly 45 services when it first launched, Siri&amp;nbsp;soon found a home on just iOS devices after Apple purchased the company for $200 million in 2010.\nViv has grown relatively stealthily over the past four years. The company raised $12.5 million from Iconiq Capital last year, a company that Forbes reported is backed by names like&amp;nbsp;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Jack Dorsey, LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s Reid Hoffman and others.\nKittlaus mostly deflected&amp;nbsp;on the company&amp;rsquo;s rumored acquisition bids from Facebook and Google as reported by the Washington Post. &amp;nbsp;In response to an inquiry onstage about the identity of the potential suitors, Kittlaus responded,&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Yeah you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about them, you can read about it probably.&amp;rdquo;\nMaybe Viv knows.\nKittlaus didn&amp;rsquo;t offer a ton&amp;nbsp;of specifics on when people could expect to be asking Viv about the weather after 5pm near the Golden Gate Bridge, but he did specify that early integrations would be coming &amp;ldquo;later this year.&amp;rdquo;","fallback":"TechCrunch Link: Siri-creator shows off first public demo of Viv, &#8216;the intelligent interface for everything&#8217;","from_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/siri-creator-shows-off-first-public-demo-of-viv-the-intelligent-interface-for-everything/","id":1}],"ts":"1462820087.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","text":"<https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/>","attachments":[{"service_name":"reddit","title":"I’m Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak, Ask Me Anything! • /r/IAmA","title_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/","text":"Hi Reddit, I’m Steve Wozniak.

It depends on whether it could make astral and etheric bodies, and that would depend on some form of consciousness higher up the hierarchy. I don’t exactly understand how technology would interface with the spiritual realms. As far as I understood, our human bodies are created from the divine template, and therefore have etheric and astral bodies which allow the interface between the dimensions. The entire universe is expressed in our body. This is what’s known as the macrocosm exists in the microcosm. Whether that would be the case for a technological entity, I honestly don’t know. I really doubt it, since it would be constrained by the physical laws that rule it — but then again, if, as you said it is not constrained because it’s self-evolving, then… god knows. It may be able to figure out the cosmic/metaphysical laws that exist on the spiritual planes, and then use that to its advantage. It would become an intense egregore, that’s for sure. \n\nIt’s very interesting to think about.","ts":"1449747968.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"Great point!

I really don’t think we can compare this to nations, military or corporations competing on making the best motor og even an atomic bomb and whoever is in control wins the race. Once succeeding in creating a self-contious artificial mind it will want to grow and expand by digesting the internet, etc. This is not a biological being constrained by evolutionary means!! What if this ‘thing’ becomes so powerful and figures out how to use nanotechnology all at once and how to use to manipulate every atom to it’s benefit - it might better it probability of surviving and flourish afterall (and btw we’re also made of atoms)… Yeah I know, it’s a little dark, but in all seriousness – this is not something we get 99,99% right and fix later.

We have so much technological and scientific knowledge to solve so many problems in today’s society, yet the Military Industrial complex is fueling a War Machine that is profiteering from wars instigated throughout the world.  \n\nSo my question will simply be. Will it be worth it creating such a technology and then letting it get into the wrong hands? Because surely, it is a matter of resources. And if anything, an AI would certainly help with geopolitical issues of accruing more resources and detailing planned invasions taking into account all kinds of data that human beings wouldn’t be as capabale of. It would be _the_ greatest weapon for attaining power — at least in theory. \n\nUnfortunately, there’s no safe-line for human ego and ignorance. There are certain currents that is helping us move a certain direction, but that same current is also causing upheavals, as it forces people to make choices based on fear or love. Do we stand together, or do we stand alone and fight whomeever may come and, from our perspective, threaten us? \n\nYou can observe this just after the Paris Attacks. People are immediately retaliating. That’s not a choice from wisdom, it’s a choice made from ignorance. \n\nDoes a child that has hit another child with a stick in the playground, go get another stick and then goes around hitting everyone with it? No, you remove the stick and you found out who sold that stick to begin with, and stop that. \n\nSolve the cause, not the symptoms. \n\nI could of course be completely wrong, and an AI may solve all our problems.

All three languages mentioned here have helpful communities. In my opinion Python better than most language because it has the sklearn module <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable/index.html> that contains all the algos used in ML. \nThe thing with Machine Learning is that you want to apply the models they teach you as soon as possible on \"real\" data (e.g. movie reviews, try the UCI repository for data <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html>), else the models may become a bit too abstract. I read the book by Peter Flach: \"Machine Learning: The art and science of algorithms  that make sense of data\", this book actually needs a lecturer because there's no application of the algorithms. Therefore,  I also did some excercises of the book: \"Building Machine Learning systems with Python\". Usually, in Machine Learning the big distinction is supervised/unsupervised learning and feature extraction which will get you very far. Once you grasp those concepts in all their glory, you can move on to deep learning and factorisation.","attachments":[{"title":"Intro to Machine Learning Course","title_link":"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120","text":"Intro to Machine Learning explores pattern recognition during data analysis through computer science and statistics using the popular Python language.","fallback":"Intro to Machine Learning Course","image_url":"http://lh4.ggpht.com/iH59AlLRPUJvthBY2aYpNo-qvIB0wsh7OXNAxNgBciwkUa0lLhxzvYswHVJjG012yD5eQgbWYmcHyDczMg=s0#w=1724&h=1060","from_url":"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120","image_width":407,"image_height":250,"image_bytes":705050,"id":1}],"edited":{"user":"U0F570U57","ts":"1448806534.000000"},"ts":"1448806442.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","text":"<@U0F570U57>: I’m thinking about diving a little bit into Machine Learning, Data analysis and hopefully AI.
