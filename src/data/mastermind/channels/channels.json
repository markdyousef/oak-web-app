I believe it would entail valuable synergies to gather inquisitive individuals from different professions and create appropriate settings in which they can share knowledge.\n\nAre we then sure that the written format is the best for such a form of discussion? There\u2019s lots of talks\/debates online where professionals in various positions discuss things from physics, to politics, and so forth. \n\n&gt;Another element, which is rather unique to this platform, is segmentation.

I am not particularly fond of the one-size-fit-all philosophy, which dominates the digital market of today. Instead of just creating a profile, maybe people should request admittance or somehow qualify for access. What do you think? How come we almost never see these mechanisms online?\n\nWell, as someone who is already a part of several invite-only groups, I think we do see it online, it\u2019s just not advertised, because of the same reason you listed; namely that they use appropriate filters that only makes the target audience pursue the goal of enrolment, so to speak, in the first place.

Perhaps philosophical questions might be too difficult to discuss since they apparently can only be understood on a level beyond thoughts. However, I believe that that assertion would constitute a very good foundation for a constructive discussion. I am confident that discussions would emerge naturally when curious people are gathered. \n\nI certainly agree. Oh, and just because self-realization and true sanity cannot happen within an obstructed thinking consciousness (perhaps see the recent video I posted on <#C0F20Q1QE> to get a grasp on what I mean by that), that doesn\u2019t mean that the pursuit of philosophy shouldn\u2019t be encouraged, because as the Ancients used to say, Philosophy is by its very nature the search for Truth. However, what the Ancients realized, and what contemporary philosophers are unfortunately not, is that the without going beyond the fetters of the ego, there can be no clear vision of what truth entails. So, yes to that end, moving from a state of opinion (doxia) to knowledge (gnosis) would be very difficult without proper guidance. \n\n&gt; I am very fascinated by the constellation of Etisk R\u00e5d.

Very interesting and challenging questions. Questions containing elements that I have not thought about.\nFirstly, I would like to stress the fact that this idea is not something revolutionary - neither with respect to setup or technology (at least not initially). In my opinion, it is more an incremental improvement of existing solutions, which I genuinely believe is necessary. It is therefore difficult to emphasise elements that explicitly differentiate the platform from existing platforms. However, I believe that the platforms you mentioned have two profound drawbacks in addition to their visually unattractive and uninteresting appearance, which this idea might be able to comply with.\nThe fact that these platforms are centred around specific topics might seem convenient. However, personally I would hate to switch between different websites depending on which topic I would like to discuss. Moreover, I am not fond of blindly delimiting subjects from eachother this dramatically since I believe that they are somehow interrelated, which takes me to my second point. One of the absolute core values of this idea is that by gathering numerous topics we obtain the potential of accumulating knowledge from different areas. Knowledge that should be distributed through different channels. In my opinion, the most valuable discussion appear when you are introduced to perspectives that you had not considered. A discussion between politicians might be interesting. However, it would probably become more interesting if experts from other professions contributed to the pool of knowledge.

How come we almost never see these mechanisms online?\nHonestly, I have not really thought about the format of the potential dialogues. I just do not see a need for another encyclopaedia, where factual questions can be answered without any form of actual dialogue. For that reason, I think it would be interesting to see dialogues where an actual conclusion is not necessarily needed.

Glad to see you around here!\n\nWell, my immediate reaction would be: Isn\u2019t that what forums are for? I know forums in neuroscience\/mind-stuff, like <http:\/\/brainmeta.com\/forum\/>, I know forums for politics, like <http:\/\/www.politicalforum.com\/> &amp; <http:\/\/www.debatepolitics.com\/>, I know forums for economics and so on and so forth. My question would be, how is your platform different than a simple forum setup?\n\nMy next question would be related to your notion of intellectual debate. For instance, according to Socratic dialogue, dialectic reasoning would be the only way of truly coming to actual conclusions and proper discussions about various subjects (see e.g.  Alcibiades) \u2014 what format for dialogue would you use? Would you use an expert panel that would start the conversation, and then let \u201clay\u201d subscribers interact with said experts in selected areas? \n\nSince you mentioned ethical and philosophical questions, I\u2019d then also perhaps say that things like that are difficult to discuss, maybe not because there\u2019s not a truth, but perhaps because that Truth can only be understood above the level of thoughts. Here I am particularly talking about a higher level of consciousness that actually has insight into why certain actions give certain outcomes, that cannot immediately be gauged by logic. \n\nOf course, a platform that delves into these things would be great, but I am afraid that it would require a very select target group of writers, because without people that can properly construct arguments and structures of logical thought, it would be difficult to start a conversation on such difficult topics without it eventually going into a circle-jerk (to use modern nomenclature) or rhetorical nonsense. \n\nJust some food for thought.","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1454509900.000004","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1454509910.000000"}},{"text":"Naturally, there are numerous unanswered questions.

I was sitting at my desk studying something totally irrelevant. For that reason, I did something that almost everybody does nowadays. I found my smartphone and opened Facebook. After browsing my news feed for a few minutes I found an unusually interesting article. The topic of the article is insignificant for now, however, after reading the article l had a profound need to articulate my position on the topic. I read the comments and what I found was that almost all of the comments were either frivolous or out of rhetorical reach. Only very few comments contained rational and deliberate arguments. Therefore, I did not leave a comment. As I see it, it would have been totally useless anyway. Afterwards, I started to think about the experience. \nI opened Slack, which to me is a highly effective communicational tool. However, it has a serious drawback. The communication almost exclusively takes place in pre-existing networks, which in most cases dramatically limits the diversity of the communication. One could argue that it is the opposite deficiency of the one that I experienced on Facebook. \nSubsequently, I did some research on intellectual fora. With the help of my brother, I found numerous interesting platforms (e.g. Medium and Quora) that I had never heard of before. Many of them approached difficult and complex topics, which I found very interesting. The tone was polite and professional and it was genuinely a satisfying experience. However, what I found was that the objectives of these platforms were to answer questions rather than spark discussions. Furthermore, the quality of their content gradually degrades as they become more commercial.\nToday, passionate debates and academic conversations are gradually replaced by digital information gathering and fact collection. Nevertheless, ethic issues and philosophical questions still exist. What would you think of an online platform that encourages intellectual debate about subjects that can not be answered by search engines and encyclopaedias? A platform driven by curious audience where everything from literature and ethics to economics and politics are discussed? The platform should be targeted exclusively towards inquisitive individuals that are able to contribute constructively.

Here\u2019s quoting from an article I was reading: \n\n\"If stocks are so crazy, how can I make money off of them?\nBecause in the LONG run, it turns out that all this speculation and volatility always cancels out to absolutely zero. The value of stocks will go up as the earnings of the underlying companies goes up.  A portion of the ongoing earnings will always flow to the shareholders as dividends.  And all this happens because of the natural ingenuity of  hardworking humans making things at a profit, and continuing to advance our knowledge and technology and make us all more productive in every field . There may come a time when we can no longer advance, but based on the fact that we\u2019re still driving around in gas-burning tanks and Home Depot is still doing all of its computing on green-on-black mainframe computers that kick you back to the beginning of the order if you make a typing mistake, I\u2019d say we have at least a lifetime left to go in this department.\n\nSo, stocks go up and pay dividends over time, and they have since the beginning of modern commerce. The total return has averaged a very lumpy but fairly dependable 10 percent per year before inflation, 7 percent after inflation. 5 of the 7 percent comes in the form of rising stock prices, and the other 2 comes from dividend payments directly from the company to you. When you\u2019re in your \u2018Stashing stage, you just let these dividends automatically reinvest in more stocks which creates a nice compounding effect.\"\n\n\u201cThis is the easy part. You buy ALL of them. The world\u2019s smartest people have done incredible studies on this for over 40 years. What they find is that the best way to make money in the stock market is to simply buy an \u201cindex fund\u201d, which is a mutual fund that automatically buys appropriate ratios of every major stock in your country\u2019s stock market, with no magic and guessing of which stocks are better than others.\n\nThe reason the index fund wins statistically is because it can be run by a simple automated set of rules \u2013 no need to pay $350M salaries to the hotshot traders running the \u201cAggressive growth fund\u201d down the street. Because there are millions of people, both smart and dumb, squabbling over the value of each stock, the Index Fund benefits and suffers from all the individual stock performances. But overall, you get the average performance of all this squabbling.\n\nIf you descend into the pit and try some squabbling yourself, you may come out ahead or drastically behind the average, but as it turns out, you can\u2019t predict in advance which squabblers (including yourself) will win and which will lose. All you can predict is that your average performance if you buy enough of these funds will be equal to the return of the market as a whole, minus the amount of fees your mutual fund charges. So by picking the index fund with the lowest fees, you automatically win. Endless statistical analysis proves this again and again. If you don\u2019t believe me, read the book \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street, or look up the topic of John Bogle \/ Bogleheads \/ and the foundation of the Vanguard company itself.\"","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1449782360.000002","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1449782395.000000"}},{"reactions":[{"count":1,"name":"+1","users":["U0F2WABLM"]}],"edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448977081.000000"},"text":"Since we have <@U0F2WABLM> on board, I thought it would be a good idea with a finance channel for discussions. :simple_smile:","ts":"1448977070.000009","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"text":"<@U0F23JM99|andrew> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977010.000008","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F23JM99"},{"text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000007","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F21G8VD"},{"text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000006","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F570U57"},{"text":"<@U0F1V9D9A|rasmus> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000005","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F1V9D9A"},{"text":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000004","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72"},{"text":"<@U0F2WABLM|sorenschmidt> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977009.000003","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F2WABLM"},{"subtype":"channel_join","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448977008.000002","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> has joined the channel"}],"topic":{"last_set":0,"value":"","creator":""},"num_members":8,"purpose":{"last_set":0,"value":"","creator":""},"members":["U0F1V9D9A","U0F1WH8AZ","U0F1ZMA72","U0F21G8VD","U0F23JM99","U0F2WABLM","U0F570U57","U0KL1MXC5"],"message_characters":6326,"id":"C0FK9AG4C"},"2":{"previous_names":[],"is_general":true,"name":"general","is_channel":true,"created":1448093508,"is_member":true,"is_archived":false,"creator":"U0F1ZMA72","messages":[{"reactions":[{"count":1,"name":"heart","users":["U0F1ZMA72"]}],"text_translated":"xml fuck here","text":"This is truly excellent.

Thank you for the kind words Mark. For those of you who do not know me, my background, passion etc.:  My educational track record so far counts a bachelor's degree from Copenhagen Business School including an exchange period in South East Asia. I am planning to pursuit a master's degree - still within business administration - however, I may spice it up with Business IT or similar.

The requirements of being a medical student are mostly just memorization of countless amounts of details about the human body, and being able to freehand write with no reference tools any question pertaining to that particular subject being studied.  As you can perhaps gauge from my tone, I somewhat disagree with the way we are being taught. In Southern University of Denmark, where I study, the courses are divided into specific core Modules, pertaining to one area \/ purpose of the body. Just to give you an idea, currently, for instance, I am studying a module called _Homeostasis_, with its main focus being on the kidneys as they are somewhat notorious for managing body fluid volume and keeping the body balanced in more ways than one, through homeostatic regulations. \n\n_Powers_: I\u2019ve always been insanely curious and experimental about consciousness and life in general. I\u2019ve always wanted to find hacks and tweaks to my life, and _unlock_ my self, so to speak. I\u2019ve realized however, that while wanting to do that and dreaming about it is fine and dandy, it\u2019s not without its sacrifices and determination that it can actually happen. As for actual \"powers\", I'm a serious meditator, mystic, and life-hacker, so for anyone interested in those pursuits, I am sure I will be able to at least be a guiding post, pushing any of you in the right direction of your own self-exploration. I also have a keen understanding of the holistic way the human body works, and I've spent many hours investigating and studying nootropics, herbs and various pharmaceuticals for life-hack purposes, so if anyone are interested in those aspects, I will be able to help there as well. \n\n_Passion_: Ever since I was a kid, I noticed that there was something quite different in my perspective of life compared to most others. I felt that there was something beneath the surface of what was going on all around me, but I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it. It felt like a big charade; a game, an illusion. My psychedelic and spiritual adventures showed me personally that I was correct. There is far more to reality than this mere concrete physical reality that we can immediately and readily see and sense through our sense-impressions. Luckily, I am not the only one of this belief. Modern physics and Quantum Physics in particular is shedding more light on this illusion that is physicality. To those that are interested in this aspect of physical reality, I can heartily recommend the book _The Holographic Universe_ by Michael Talbot. I may talk about this more in <#C0F20Q1QE>, when the time is right. \n\n_Purpose_: I believe my purpose has always been to share wisdom, insight and generally love and compassion toward all people. My interest in becoming a doctor has actually always been secondary to seeking a form of deep healing for not only myself but all of mankind. The great old physician and psychiatrist Carl G. Jung used to have a saying, _\u201cOnly a wounded doctor can hope to heal\u201d_\n\nWell, to my eyes, it is quite clear in this day and age, a lot of people are walking around wounded and in delusion of their true nature. In my opinion, it is not without sacrifice and delving into the recesses of the mind that the truth of the matter is found and the ultimate help, be given.","ts":"1448352814.000004","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"reactions":[{"count":1,"name":"+1","users":["U0F1WH8AZ"]}],"text_translated":"xml fuck here","text":"Lets get to it.

Though I\u2019m extremely happy with my job I still have this deep burning desire to create my own thing, with the best and brighest people on earth. \nPowers: Curiosity and Rapid learning. My curiosity for knowledge and understanding the universe is probably my biggest power. My curiosity has (and will) lead me to explore and wanting to learn about different areas, which has forced me to become a fairly rapid learner by understanding how I learn. \nPassion: I try to limit my passions and activities to three core areas, due to lack of time. Technology, The Mind (Human, Artificial and Universal) and Biohacking. I\u2019m cultivating my knowledge in technology by learning to program (predominantly JS), reading, and really just from going to work and listening to colleagues everyday.

For example automatically recognizing that a \"dog\"  is some type of animal. or that \"fuscarium\" has been used in soil.

I hope you others may find it helpful as well for whatever your goals may be: <https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/getdisciplined\/comments\/33jijb\/method_a_goalsetting_fix_that_will_transform_your\/>\n\nI usually keep mental tabs on my goals, but I will begin writing them down daily in the manner expressed. It may give a bit more oomph to the transformation. Obsession used productively is a great thing. \n\nIn NLP and spiritual transformational systems, we use something similar that\u2019s called auto-suggestion. Before sleep, every night, you choose a particular idea you would like to impress upon your unconscious systems. It could, \u201cI am healthy\u201d, or \u201cI am happy\u201d, or \u201cI accomplish my goals\u201d, and you repeat that phrase 40 repetitions at least before you fall asleep. You do this every night, and when you wake up in the morning, you start your day with that. As you find the impregnation being succesful, you can then change it to something else, but give it at least a month or so for obvious changes to occur. This goes very well with meditation because it allows the link between conscious and unconscious mind to increase. More energy will be readily available. If you have questions regarding auto-suggestion, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. I will make a full post on it, should it be wanted\/desired.","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1451916827.000002","attachments":[{"thumb_height":256,"thumb_width":256,"title":"[Method] A Goal-Setting Fix That Will Transform Your Life\u2014That You'll Find Nowhere Else [X-Post r\/LifeHacks] \u2022 \/r\/getdisciplined","service_name":"reddit","title_link":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/getdisciplined\/comments\/33jijb\/method_a_goalsetting_fix_that_will_transform_your\/","text":"Do you obsessively want to accomplish your goals?

Specifically, it is a time marked by a certain phase of the moon following the spring equinox, for all magical calendars must take into account both the sun and the moon. All four seasonal intervals are a good time for fire rituals: the fire rituals in winter are to support the kalva (time of retreat) and the burning of obstacles, and the fire ritual of the spring equinox is to support the prayers and new years resolutions made on that day, similar to how old traditions might sacrifice an animal before a grand voyage\u201d_","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1451740980.000007"},{"text":"<!channel>:","type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","ts":"1451740937.000006"},{"text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1451740897.000005","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1ZMA72","type":"message","user":"U0F570U57"},{"text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1451740897.000004","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1ZMA72","type":"message","user":"U0F21G8VD"},{"reactions":[{"count":1,"name":"+1","users":["U0F1WH8AZ"]}],"text":"I hope everyone started 2016 on a highnote and are ready to the challenges and lessons to come.

Doshas are energies that are found throughout the the human body and mind. Similarly to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), each of the three doshas reflect elements. \n\n- Vata: *Ether and Air.* \n\nSome of its qualities: Dry, Light, Cold, Rough, Subtle, Mobile, Clear. \n\n- Pitta: *Fire and Water.* \n\nSome of its qualities: Oily, Sharp, Hot, Light, Mobile, Liquid. \n\n- Kapha: *Earth and Water*. \n\nSome of its qualities: Heavy, Slow, Cold, Oily, Slimy (smooth), Dense, Soft, Static (stable), Cloudy (sticky). \n\nSo in the Ayurvedic system, a person with a constitution of Vata has physical qualities that correspond to the Ether and the Air element. This will usually be reflected as: thin build, quick thinking, fast moving, hard to gain weight, low Agni (digestive fire) with low or irregular appetite and digestion, tendency to constipation and gas, emotional affective state leaning toward anxiety and fear, personality leaning towards vivacious, talkative, social and outgoing. \n\nA person with the Pitta constitution will have qualities reflective of Fire and Water elements, so here one will observe things like a fiery personality, high Agni (digestive fire) and quick digestion, oily skin, medium build, can gain weight but also lose weight equally easy, personality leaning towards being in control, intense, ambitious, and the negative affective state leaning toward jealousy and anger. \n\nA person with the Kapha constitution will have qualities reflective of Earth and Water elements, so here one will observe solid body frame, calm temperament, gains weight easily and hard to lose, slow digestion, personality leaning towards reserved, laid back, concerned, and negative affective state leaning toward posessive, greedy and withdrawn. \n\nWhile there is often one dosha in predominance according to this system based on bodily constitution, most people have a second dosha with strong influence. They refer to this as a dual-doshic constitution. \n\nSo for people still struggling with health and looking to optimize their health to their best ability and thus also increase their ability in meditation, I suggest taking a test such as <http:\/\/www.naturesformulary.com\/contents\/dosha-test> one and see if you have an excess of one of the doshas. If you do, I suggest trying a pacifying diet that corresponds to that dosha, and see if your health improves. \n\nI hope this post was helpful to some of you.","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1457686770.000002","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1457686838.000000"}},{"text":"Yeah, I know how you feel mate","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1456090186.000002"},{"text":"I\u2019m kinda pissed to be honest!

That\u2019s up for each person to decide, and truly, with a multidimensional perspective, one may think it doesn\u2019t matter much. I mean, this is just one Earth, there are other Earths to go to, if need be, but that\u2019s not for the majority of people (people that do not cultivate nor reach enlightenment in this lifetime are destined to come back). So one may ask oneself about what the most compassionate choice would be. \n\nOf course, every person\u2019s diet requirement are different, and that\u2019s why it is difficult to suggest something like a Vegan or Vegetarian diet for everyone. \nThat is not feasible. There are some conditions that require various types of animal meat to function optimally. However, with the case of meat, there\u2019s not just the environmental impact that is questionable, there\u2019s also the known fact that meat takes more energy to process, it awakens the passions, and so forth. This is something that can be experienced when one increases one\u2019s sensitivity significantly, but as mentioned, some people need various substances to functional optimally.  \n\nI suggest you check out this fantastic resource called Healing with Whole Foods: <http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Healing-With-Whole-Foods-Traditions\/dp\/1556434308> \n\nWhen we think about things like GMO, GE seeds and plants, you will start to lose out on the benefits of the pranic supreme that exists within those plants. There are ways, not known to science yet, on how to measure bioenergetic potential of plants, vegetables, herbs, and so forth, and unfortunately, GMO does not provide the same bioenergetic potentials. Because of that, it can also lead to severe ramifications down the line in terms of cancerous growths, and various other destabilizations of internal cellular machinery. There\u2019s the unfortunate case where doctors in the 40-70s prescribed artificial Estrogen to postmenopausal women, and the ramifications were an increased incidence of breast cancer and thus overall mortality. This was of course not expected, but was found out, after-the-fact. \n\nCurrently, there\u2019s not just the problem of GMO, but also artificial sugars, countless carnicogens and lots of toxic substances that are added to most of the food we can buy today because of the increased use of pesticides and various toxic chemicals to increase the crop size.","ts":"1455699896.000002","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"text":"I believe incentives like this, vertical farming, GE seeds and plants, cultured meat(in-vitro meat) is the future of the human food-chain in large.

You really can\u2019t go wrong with those sorts of basics. \n\nFor immune health, if you\u2019re worried about coming down with flu or the common cold, I can recommend EpiCor, which is a scientifically validated prebiotic that increases immune system activity. Besides that, the mushroom called Reishi Mushroom is extremely effective at improving general health and immune system activity. I\u2019d personally be taking it daily if it wasn\u2019t so expensive. \n\nIf you\u2019re more interested in muscular and athletic performance stuff, then stuff like BCAAs, Beta-Alanine, Creatine and D-Aspartic Acid will do you much good. \n\nFor manly health, testosterone levels and related, I\u2019ve heard some people have good results from Maca and cycling Tongkat Ali. \n\nFor cognitive performance - I thought I might as well mention it - lots of people love the L-Theanine\/Caffeine combination, so if you\u2019re already a coffee drinker, you may want to take a look into that. L-Theanine is the active component of Green Tea, and has a balancing effects on brain waves, increasing the alpha-waves in particular, which are associated with heightened mindfulness and relaxation. In a 2:1 ratio (200mg L-Theanine, 100mg caffeine), studies have found an improved response in terms of cognitive performance. If you wish, I can share you those studies, if it\u2019s something you want to pursue. \n\nSo, it really depends on your temperament, your goals, and ultimately, your desire for experimentation. \n\nDiet, exercise and a good amount of sleep will go a _long_ way, but when you have that in order, adding a few supplements here and there can really help your body perform at its optimum level (which is really just its natural level..). \n\nHope that helped! :simple_smile:","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448979685.000006","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448980452.000000"}},{"text":"Anders\/Mark: What would you recommend as a starter kit, due to supplements?","type":"message","user":"U0F2WABLM","ts":"1448979242.000005"},{"text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977288.000004","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F21G8VD"},{"text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977279.000003","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F570U57"},{"text":"Interesting.

Link: <http:\/\/deltabed.no\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/jording_og_helse.pdf>\n\n*Conclusion:* _De Flora et al. wrote the following: \u201cSince the late 20th century, chronic degenerative diseases have overcome infectious disease as the major causes of death in the 21st century, so an increase in human longevity will depend on finding an intervention that inhibits the development of these diseases and slows their progress\u201d_\n\n_Could such an intervention be located right beneath our feet? Earthing research, observations, and related theories raise an intriguing possibility about the Earth\u2019s surface electrons as an untapped health resource\u2014the Earth as a \u201cglobal treatment table.\u201d Emerging evidence shows that contact with the Earth\u2014whether being outside barefoot or indoors connected to grounded conductive systems\u2014may be a simple, natural, and yet profoundly effective environmental strategy against chronic stress, ANS dysfunction, inflammation, pain, poor sleep, disturbed HRV, hypercoagulable blood, and many common health disorders, including cardiovascular disease. The research done to date supports the concept that grounding or earthing the human body may be an essential element in the health equation along with sunshine, clean air and water, nutritious food, and physical activity._ \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nI find this topic absolutely fascinating, because it is such a simple solution, yet profound effects are found from it. We\u2019ve found that a lot of day to day modern lifestyle diseases come from simply being _too_ stressed out. Well, they\u2019ve found out that the Earth actually protects you from that sort of thing, by forcing your body to activate more of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) activation instead of going amok in the sympathetic nervous system.  \n\nQuoting from relevant study under 2.4.1: _\u201cThe immediate decrease in SC indicates a rapid activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and corresponding deactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The immediate increase in SC at cessation of grounding indicates an opposite effect. Increased RR, stabilization of BO, and slight rise in heart rate suggest the start of a metabolic healing response necessitating an increase in oxygen consumption.\u201d_\n\nSimply said: *awesome.* \n\nI should receive an Earthing device shortly, so I will most likely report back after a couple of week\u2019s usage.","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448892850.000002","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448892953.000000"}},{"edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448812624.000000"},"attachments":[{"image_bytes":13298,"text":"Psychosom Med. 2003 Jul-Aug;65(4):564-70.

In other words, the sacred manifests itself in physical form. \n3. Because all matter is made frmo the sacred, all things posssess a soul, a sacred intelligence, or _logos_. \n4. Because human beings are generated out of this same substance, it is possible for human beings to communicate with the soul or intelligence in all other matter and for those intelligences to communicate with human beings. \n5. Human beings were ignorant when they arrived here, and the powers of the Earth and the various intelligences in all things began to teach them how to be human. This is still true. It is not possible for new generations to become human without this communication or reatching from the natural world. \n6. Parts of the Earth can manifest more or less sacredness, just like human beings. A human being can never know when some part of the Earth might be expressing deep levels of sacredness or begin talking to him or here. Therefore, it is important to cultivate attentiveness of mind. \n7. Human beings are only one of the many life-forms of the Earth, neither more nor less important than the others.

Tobacco, for ancient peoples, was considered a holy plant, a plant with great spiritual powers, whose purpose was to facilitate communication between human beings and the sacred powers of the Earth and the Universe. This same dynamic, the splitting apart of the body and the spirit of a thing, has occurred with a great many other things that have always been considered intrinsically spiritual in nature. Fasting is one of them. \n\nFor the past five hundred years the trend has been, increasingly, to view matter as devoid of spirit, intelligence, soul, or purpose. A lump of rock \u2014 merely inanimate matter, a resource or something on which to stub your toe, certainly not something filled with soul. But throughout human history, human cultural perspectives about such things have been very different. In earlier times, it was commonly understood, irrespective of culture or historical period, that the world was alive, that all things possessed souls, that human beings were only one of a multitude of ensouled beings, and that there was a constant soul energy going out of and into our bodies as we traveled through the world. Beyond any health aspects it was known to posess, fasting, like tobacco, was one way, an important way, to deepen communication with the sacred. Fasting, it was recognized, increased human sensitivity to the nonmaterial world, enhanced personal experience of the sacredness of both self and Universe, and helped the fasting person regain a sense of orientation and purpose. \n\nCompared to the mechanistic worldview that is now so dominant, oler perspectives of the Universe are much more complex and multidimensional. Ancient and nonindustrial cultures understood that the Universe and the Earth were deeply sacred. Human beings, along with all other life-forms, are, within those earlier perspectives, considered to be inextricably embedded in this sacred world, indeed to be an integral part of it. These ancient viewpoints are not _beliefs_ as we now understand the term but are representative of a living experience. They lie deep within the epistemology \u2014 the way people see reality \u2014 of all older cultures.

Thereby a pool of immature neurons is generated that are potentially recruitable by subsequent cognitive stimuli. Along these lines, we here tested whether auditory stimuli might exert a similar non-specific effect on adult neurogenesis in mice. We used the standard noise level in the animal facility as baseline and compared this condition to white noise, pup calls, and silence. In addition, as patterned auditory stimulus without ethological relevance to mice we used piano music by Mozart (KV 448). All stimuli were transposed to the frequency range of C57BL\/6 and hearing was objectified with acoustic evoked potentials. We found that except for white noise all stimuli, including silence, increased precursor cell proliferation (assessed 24 h after labeling with bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU). This could be explained by significant increases in BrdU-labeled Sox2-positive cells (type-1\/2a). But after 7 days, only silence remained associated with increased numbers of BrdU-labeled cells. Compared to controls at this stage, exposure to silence had generated significantly increased numbers of BrdU\/NeuN-labeled neurons.  _Our results indicate that the unnatural absence of auditory input as well as spectrotemporally rich albeit ethological irrelevant stimuli activate precursor cells-in the case of silence also leading to greater numbers of newborn immature neurons-whereas ambient and unstructured background auditory stimuli do not_\u201c\n\nTL:DR: \u201cSilence is better than auditory input for the growth of new brain cels.\"","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1452109595.000002","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1452109657.000000"}},{"text":":innocent:","type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","ts":"1449513133.000002"},{"text":"As Lao Tzu said, so elegantly, \n\n\u201cIf there is right in the soul, \nThere will be beauty in the person, \nIf there is beauty in the person, \nThere will be harmony in the person, \nIf there is harmony in the home, \nThere will be order in the nation, \nIf there is order in the nation,\nThere will be peace in the world.\u201d\n\nStart today.

There sits the meditator parked on his little cushion. Is he out giving blood? No. Is he busy working with disaster victims? No. But let us examine his motivation. Why is he doing this? His intention is to purge his own of anger, prejudice and ill-will. He is actively engaged in the process of getting rid of greed, tension and insensitivity. Those are the very items which obstruct his compassion for others. \n\nUntil they are gone, any good works that he does are likely to be just an extension of his own ego and of no real help in the long run. Harm in the name of help is one of the oldest games. The grand inquistor of the Spanish Inquistion spouts the lofties of motives. The Salem witchcraft trials were conducted for the public good. Examine the personal lives of advanced meditators and you will often find them engaged in humaniatiran service. You will seldom find them as crusading missionaries who are willing to sacrifice certain individuals for the sake of some pious idea. The fact is we are more selfish than we know. The ego has a way of turning the lofties of activites into trash if it is allowed free range. Through meditation we become aware of ourselves exactly as we are, by waking up to the numerous subtle ways that we manifest our own selfishness. Then we truly begin to be genuinely selfless. Cleansing yourself of selfishness is not a selfish activity. \n\n_Meditation is running away from reality_\n\nIncorrect. Meditation is running into reality. It does not insulate you from the pain of life. It allows you to delve so deeply into life and all its aspects that you pierce the pain barrier and you go beyond suffering. Vipassana is a practice done with the specific intention of facing reality, to fully experience life just as it is and to cope with exactly what you find. It allows you to blow aside the illusions and to free yourself from all those polite little lies you tell yourself all the time. What is there is there. You are who you are, and lying to yourself about your own weaknesses and motivations only binds you tighter on the wheel of illusion. Vipassana meditation is not an attempt to forget yourself or cover up your troubles. It is learning to look at yourself exactly as you are. See what is there, accept it fully. Only then can you change it. \n\nExcerpts taken from: *Mindfulness in Plain English written by Venerable H.

The idea was to demonstrate to his students the effects of long-term meditation. Curious to see if there was a difference, John agreed. After his EEG was recorded\u2014and yes, his brain activity was unusual\u2014the meditator asked about the lab\u2019s research. John told him about our work on the neural basis of insight, and he was intrigued. There was some time left in the session, so John asked him if he wanted to do a series of remote associates problems. He enthusiastically agreed. John was sure that the meditator would blow these problems away. After all, he had a superbly honed mind and a doctorate to boot. However, after he attempted about a dozen problems, it looked like he was going to tank. He timed out on puzzle after puzzle without solving a single one. After watching a couple of dozen painful failures, John was about to stop the session to spare the Zen meditator further embarrassment. But then he got one right. And then another and another. From that point on, he got nearly all of them right. This was unprecedented. Over the years, we have tested hundreds of participants and found no evidence that practice during a single session improves performance on remote associates problems. Nevertheless, the Zen meditator showed an amazing\u2014and very sudden\u2014improvement in his performance. This was an informal observation rather than a formal experiment, so we can\u2019t offer a definitive explanation for the meditator\u2019s turnaround. We do, however, have an educated hypothesis. Years of intensive meditation may have granted our Zen subject with hyper-refined attention. His mind was so still, focused, and concentrated that associations didn\u2019t spontaneously pop into his awareness. However, his years of mental training also afforded him a great deal of self-control. Failing to solve these problems within his regular state of mind, he had the ability to try out different ways of allocating his attention until he hit on the broad focus that optimized his performance. Once he found the right spread of attention, his superior self-control allowed him to maintain it consistently, resulting in outstanding performance._\n\nAnd why don\u2019t you check out <http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2015\/08\/150827083659.htm> &amp; <http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2015\/07\/150730130729.htm> while you\u2019re at it.

That is often the case when it comes to that sort of thing. Without practical experience, all those words and descriptions will always just be like a finger pointing to the moon, but never the moon itself. _C\u2019est ne pas un pipe_. \n\nTherefore, I think the best thing to move this forward, is simply to introduce a beginner technique. I\u2019ve written this sort of beginner guide to several people \u2014 so please do try it out, if just for 5 minutes every day (though I recommend at least 10-30 minutes daily) for a week, and come back and tell me how it went or how it was terrible and there\u2019s no point to it all! Any sort of feedback is appreciated. \n\nThere are many different techniques of meditation one can use, but they all come down to one thing: _stilling_ the mind. What does stilling the mind mean exactly? \n\nWell, consider a glass of muddy water. When you first look at this water, you\u2019ll think, well\u2026 this is not going anywhere \u2014 but as you continue watching, the mud slowly descends to the ground in the glass, and what\u2019s left? A clear glass of water. In this metaphor, your thoughts and emotional turmoil is like all this mud. By just watching this mud for extended periods of time, in complete silence, the mud starts to clear out, and we\u2019re left with what\u2019s called by the Taoists _10000 miles of clear sky_, a state of utterly clear awareness where we are fully present and alive, blissful in the moment. Please keep this metaphor in mind when you meditate. \n\nSo, when you are new to meditation, you simply need to work on calming your mind, which involves developing a one-pointed attention and relaxation. I suggest you start with 10 minutes, but at least twice daily (if you are to see significant results). Slowly increase the length to 12, then 14, then 16 minutes and so forth. You are not actually meditating at that point, but simply improving your capacity to do so. \n\nDuring this period of time, do your best focusing on the breath. How does one focus on the breath? One simply notes internally that the breath is moving in, it stops for a while, then it moves out, stops for a while, then moves in again. By continuously focusing on the breath (being aware of it), the thoughts will rest and eventually settle. The mind becomes more clear, and that's the point where true meditation begins. \n\nFrustration has no place in meditation practice, so you should always treat your mind with calmness. When you are distracted away from the breath, remember that you cannot remove thoughts. Just witness them and realize your distraction and move your awareness back to the breath. Tell your mind \u201cthank you for letting me know of my distraction, so that I may return to the breath.\u201d The thoughts will fade away naturally. \n\nSome people misunderstand how to focus or be aware of the breath and think that they ought to struggle. This is not the case. A metaphor that helps here is like holding jelly in your hand. Do not squish too tight, lest it is lost. Do not hold too freely either, because then it is also lost. Attend to the breath like you attend to a loved one. \n\nConsider that, after all, your breath keeps you alive. Ought you not to appreciate it fully with attention? When you realize the profundity of the breath, it helps with the awareness and one-pointed attention on it. \n\nThis is one of the greatest beginner techniques for developing a calm mind, and was recommend by Siddharta Gautama as a method that can bring one directly toward enlightenment, through all 8 samadhis by correctly following the breath \u2014 so do not think it is not an advanced technique: in some of the most simplest of solutions, the most advanced of experiences can be attained. \n\nBest of luck. Please report back if you do go ahead and try it. As we move along in time, I will share more.","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1449005164.000004","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1449005321.000000"}},{"text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: Meditation","ts":"1449004409.000003","topic":"Meditation","subtype":"channel_topic","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: What is self-realization?","ts":"1449002747.000002","topic":"What is self-realization?","subtype":"channel_topic","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"text":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977315.000003","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F21G8VD"},{"text":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","ts":"1448977308.000002","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F570U57"},{"subtype":"channel_join","type":"message","user":"U0F2WABLM","ts":"1448319804.000002","text":"<@U0F2WABLM|sorenschmidt> has joined the channel"},{"text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: Introduction to Meditaton","ts":"1448125830.000003","topic":"Introduction to Meditaton","subtype":"channel_topic","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel topic: Meditation introduction","ts":"1448125814.000002","topic":"Meditation introduction","subtype":"channel_topic","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"subtype":"channel_join","type":"message","user":"U0F23JM99","ts":"1448119746.000002","text":"<@U0F23JM99|andrew> has joined the channel"},{"subtype":"channel_join","type":"message","user":"U0F1V9D9A","ts":"1448105282.000002","text":"<@U0F1V9D9A|rasmus> has joined the channel"},{"reactions":[{"count":1,"name":"thinking_face","users":["U0F1ZMA72"]}],"edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448102549.000000"},"text":"To start off with, those that may not know much about meditation, let's distill it into its main components and talk a bit about it. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to post them here. I am here sharing the most rudimentary about meditation to stir conversation. \n\nMeditation is the Art and Science of training the mind. It is the systematic process of training the mind that allows people to experience great benefits. A regular sitting practice has been shown, scientifically mind you, to enhance focus and concentration, lower blood pressure, improve sleep quality. It\u2019s been used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Meditation allows the practictioner to gain insight into their personalities, relationships, behaviors, and makes it easier to reverse past conditioning by increasing overall awareness and sensitivity. The enhanced awareness is enormously helpful in work and personal relationships, as it adds depth to one\u2019s interactions with others. The emotional stability that comes from the calming and relaxation effects of meditation need also be mentioned. All of these effects, however, are just side-benefits, or if you will, side-effects of meditation. \n\nFully developed meditational ability gives rise to increasingly wonderful sensations and mental states characterized by deep mental and physical relaxation, inner joy, peace, happiness and profound inner peace. These are states that open the mind to an intuitive grasp of the interconnectedness of all that is and dispels the illusion of separateness told and created by the ego. \n\nHowever, even those peak states of meditation are not the ultimate goal or benefit from meditation. While bliss, joy and tranquility are all very real and enticing, it can often be interrupted by sickness, difficult life circumstances and other influences. It also offers no protection from the difficulties of averting the draw toward lust, greed, aversion and sloth. They are simply a means to a higher goal. That goal, of course, is _awakening_. \n\nInstead of awakening, words one might use can be, _self-realization_ and _enlightenment_ . Each of these words simply refers to a cognitive event that brings lasting freedom from suffering where one is unaffected by aging, disease or mere circumstance. It is not some transient experience of divine unity and dissolution of the ego. No, rather, it\u2019s the attainment of true genuine wisdom (by the traditions called prajna wisdom) that comes from profound realization and opening one\u2019s eyes to the ultimate truth, which is the the only true and worthy goal of any spiritual tradition. \n\nA mind with this type of prajna wisdom experiences life and death as a great adventure, with the clear purpose of manifesting compassion, peace, and love toward all beings.","ts":"1448102444.000008","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message"},{"text":"Welcome everyone. I hope this channel can be a shared platform for communicating ideas and thoughts regarding the events that surround the concept of awakening, namely that of deconditioning the mind from past \"negative\" programming allowing it to operate at peak states of consciousness, by some called being in the _flow_, by the more spiritual traditions called _jh\u00e3na_ and _samadhis_, which are deep absorptive states of consciousness, marked by an extremely heightened awareness and improved cognitive functioning. May we all strive well to achieve the goal of not only improving our mind's abilities to stay more present and be more blissful in our daily lives, but also awakening the latent abilities that are part of our true humanity.","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448101264.000006","edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448101290.000000"}},{"text":"Awesome bro!","type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","ts":"1448101195.000005"},{"text":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> has joined the channel","ts":"1448101043.000004","subtype":"channel_join","inviter":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72"},{"text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> set the channel purpose: Everything about exploring the deepest recesses of one's mind through meditation for the ultimate goal of instigating true awakening","ts":"1448101043.000003","subtype":"channel_purpose","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","type":"message","purpose":"Everything about exploring the deepest recesses of one's mind through meditation for the ultimate goal of instigating true awakening"},{"subtype":"channel_join","type":"message","user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1448101042.000002","text":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> has joined the channel"}],"topic":{"last_set":1449004410,"value":"Meditation","creator":"U0F1WH8AZ"},"num_members":8,"purpose":{"last_set":1448101043,"value":"Everything about exploring the deepest recesses of one's mind through meditation for the ultimate goal of instigating true awakening","creator":"U0F1WH8AZ"},"members":["U0F1V9D9A","U0F1WH8AZ","U0F1ZMA72","U0F21G8VD","U0F23JM99","U0F2WABLM","U0F570U57","U0KL1MXC5"],"message_characters":30765,"id":"C0F20Q1QE"},"6":{"previous_names":[],"is_general":false,"name":"random","is_channel":true,"created":1448093508,"is_member":false,"is_archived":true,"creator":"U0F1ZMA72","messages":[{"text":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> archived the channel (w\/ 1 member)","ts":"1448093561.000002","subtype":"channel_archive","user":"U0F1ZMA72","members":["U0F1ZMA72"],"type":"message"},{"subtype":"channel_join","type":"message","user":"U0F1ZMA72","ts":"1448093508.517919","text":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> has joined the channel"}],"topic":{"last_set":0,"value":"Non-work banter and water cooler conversation","creator":""},"num_members":0,"purpose":{"last_set":0,"value":"A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channels.","creator":""},"members":[],"message_characters":92,"id":"C0F1YU55L"},"7":{"previous_names":[],"is_general":false,"name":"self_development","is_channel":true,"created":1448097368,"is_member":true,"is_archived":false,"creator":"U0F1ZMA72","messages":[{"edited":{"user":"U0F1WH8AZ","ts":"1473430912.000000"},"attachments":[{"image_bytes":67158,"title":"See the Film | Minimalism Film","service_name":"Minimalism Film","image_width":444,"title_link":"http:\/\/minimalismfilm.com\/watch\/","image_height":250,"image_url":"http:\/\/minimalismfilm.com\/files\/2016\/03\/DesktopWallpaper-1.jpg","text":"Purchase Minimalism and receive 6 hours of bonus content PURCHASE | $20 Watch Now There are still a few remaining theatrical screenings of Minimalism.

The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will, before it sees the shadow of the whip; the second best will run as well as the first one, just before the whip reaches its skin; the third one will run when it feels pain on its body; the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn to run._\n\n_\"When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. But this is a mistake\", Master Suzuki says. When you learn too easily, you're tempted not to work hard, not to penetrate to the marrow of a practice._\n\n_\"If you study calligraphy, you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art, and in life.\" The best horse, according to Suzuki, may be the worst horse. And the worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever it is practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones._\n\n_\"Suzuki's parable of the four horses has haunted me ever since I first heard it.

Kittlaus called on Viv to pay a buddy $20 and all that followed was a tap of the pay button through a Venmo integration and,&amp;nbsp;all of a sudden,&amp;nbsp;his friend had been paid.\nIndeed, Kittlaus specified that&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;perfecting the third-party ecosystem&amp;rdquo; will&amp;nbsp;be critical to the soul of their mission. Kittlaus said that Viv would one day become a &amp;ldquo;primary source&amp;rdquo; for users.\nA clear&amp;nbsp;strength of the Viv platform was the &amp;ldquo;stackability&amp;rdquo; of inquiries. As opposed to short-term-memoried platforms like Siri, Viv was able to embrace follow-up questions without stuttering or gasping for context that was just said seconds before.\nIn an interview onstage with TechCrunch Editor-in-Chief Matthew Panzarino, Viv CEO Dag Kittlaus discussed what differentiated this assistant from the dozens of others.\nKittlaus detailed the real secret sauce of Viv was something called &amp;ldquo;dynamic program generation,&amp;rdquo; which allows the AI-powered assistant to understand intent and generate a program itself to best answer the query.\n&amp;ldquo;Instead of having to write every code instructed, you&amp;rsquo;re really just describing what you want it to do,&amp;rdquo; said Kittlaus.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The whole idea of Viv is that developers can go in and build any experience that they want.&amp;rdquo;\nThroughout the demo, mental comparisons to Siri were inevitable.&amp;nbsp;What was initially hailed as a massive advance has grown a bit more maligned in recent years as complaints have piled on that Siri&amp;rsquo;s accuracy isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to be relied on.\nAll of this is particularly interesting because Kittlaus co-founded Siri in 2007 after spinning the underlying technologies out of the Stanford Research Institute. He initially saw a future for&amp;nbsp;Siri&amp;nbsp;that looked quite&amp;nbsp;similar to what he has envisioned for Viv. Though his company supported nearly 45 services when it first launched, Siri&amp;nbsp;soon found a home on just iOS devices after Apple purchased the company for $200 million in 2010.\nViv has grown relatively stealthily over the past four years. The company raised $12.5 million from Iconiq Capital last year, a company that Forbes reported is backed by names like&amp;nbsp;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Jack Dorsey, LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s Reid Hoffman and others.\nKittlaus mostly deflected&amp;nbsp;on the company&amp;rsquo;s rumored acquisition bids from Facebook and Google as reported by the Washington Post. &amp;nbsp;In response to an inquiry onstage about the identity of the potential suitors, Kittlaus responded,&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Yeah you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about them, you can read about it probably.&amp;rdquo;\nMaybe Viv knows.\nKittlaus didn&amp;rsquo;t offer a ton&amp;nbsp;of specifics on when people could expect to be asking Viv about the weather after 5pm near the Golden Gate Bridge, but he did specify that early integrations would be coming &amp;ldquo;later this year.&amp;rdquo;","id":1,"fallback":"TechCrunch Link: Siri-creator shows off first public demo of Viv, &#8216;the intelligent interface for everything&#8217;","thumb_url":"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/tcdisrupt_ny16-8916.jpg?fit=200%2C150&ssl=1","from_url":"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/05\/09\/siri-creator-shows-off-first-public-demo-of-viv-the-intelligent-interface-for-everything\/"}]},{"reactions":[{"count":1,"name":"nerd_face","users":["U0F1ZMA72"]},{"count":1,"name":"+1","users":["U0KL1MXC5"]}],"attachments":[{"thumb_height":213,"thumb_width":320,"title":"I\u2019m Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak, Ask Me Anything! \u2022 \/r\/IAmA","service_name":"reddit","title_link":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IAmA\/comments\/4apj5f\/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything\/","text":"Hi Reddit, I\u2019m Steve Wozniak.

It depends on whether it could make astral and etheric bodies, and that would depend on some form of consciousness higher up the hierarchy. I don\u2019t exactly understand how technology would interface with the spiritual realms. As far as I understood, our human bodies are created from the divine template, and therefore have etheric and astral bodies which allow the interface between the dimensions. The entire universe is expressed in our body. This is what\u2019s known as the macrocosm exists in the microcosm. Whether that would be the case for a technological entity, I honestly don\u2019t know. I really doubt it, since it would be constrained by the physical laws that rule it \u2014 but then again, if, as you said it is not constrained because it\u2019s self-evolving, then\u2026 god knows. It may be able to figure out the cosmic\/metaphysical laws that exist on the spiritual planes, and then use that to its advantage.

We have so much technological and scientific knowledge to solve so many problems in today\u2019s society, yet the Military Industrial complex is fueling a War Machine that is profiteering from wars instigated throughout the world.  \n\nSo my question will simply be. Will it be worth it creating such a technology and then letting it get into the wrong hands? Because surely, it is a matter of resources. And if anything, an AI would certainly help with geopolitical issues of accruing more resources and detailing planned invasions taking into account all kinds of data that human beings wouldn\u2019t be as capabale of.

No, you remove the stick and you found out who sold that stick to begin with, and stop that. \n\nSolve the cause, not the symptoms. \n\nI could of course be completely wrong, and an AI may solve all our problems.

I also recommend to use Python instead of R for data science, not because R is \"bad\", but because Python  can be used in other fields (Web Dev, games, API programming etc.) in contrast to R. All three languages mentioned here have helpful communities. In my opinion Python better than most language because it has the sklearn module <http:\/\/scikit-learn.sourceforge.net\/stable\/index.html> that contains all the algos used in ML. \nThe thing with Machine Learning is that you want to apply the models they teach you as soon as possible on \"real\" data (e.g. movie reviews, try the UCI repository for data <http:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets.html>), else the models may become a bit too abstract. I read the book by Peter Flach: \"Machine Learning: The art and science of algorithms  that make sense of data\", this book actually needs a lecturer because there's no application of the algorithms. Therefore,  I also did some excercises of the book: \"Building Machine Learning systems with Python\". Usually, in Machine Learning the big distinction is supervised\/unsupervised learning and feature extraction which will get you very far. Once you grasp those concepts in all their glory, you can move on to deep learning and factorisation.","ts":"1448806442.000002","user":"U0F570U57","type":"message"},{"text":"<@U0F570U57>: I\u2019m thinking about diving a little bit into Machine Learning, Data analysis and hopefully AI.
