Here\u2019s quoting from an article I was reading: \n\n\"If stocks are so crazy, how can I make money off of them?\nBecause in the LONG run, it turns out that all this speculation and volatility always cancels out to absolutely zero. The value of stocks will go up as the earnings of the underlying companies goes up.  A portion of the ongoing earnings will always flow to the shareholders as dividends.  And all this happens because of the natural ingenuity of  hardworking humans making things at a profit, and continuing to advance our knowledge and technology and make us all more productive in every field . There may come a time when we can no longer advance, but based on the fact that we\u2019re still driving around in gas-burning tanks and Home Depot is still doing all of its computing on green-on-black mainframe computers that kick you back to the beginning of the order if you make a typing mistake, I\u2019d say we have at least a lifetime left to go in this department.\n\nSo, stocks go up and pay dividends over time, and they have since the beginning of modern commerce. The total return has averaged a very lumpy but fairly dependable 10 percent per year before inflation, 7 percent after inflation. 5 of the 7 percent comes in the form of rising stock prices, and the other 2 comes from dividend payments directly from the company to you. When you\u2019re in your \u2018Stashing stage, you just let these dividends automatically reinvest in more stocks which creates a nice compounding effect.\"\n\n\u201cThis is the easy part. You buy ALL of them. The world\u2019s smartest people have done incredible studies on this for over 40 years. What they find is that the best way to make money in the stock market is to simply buy an \u201cindex fund\u201d, which is a mutual fund that automatically buys appropriate ratios of every major stock in your country\u2019s stock market, with no magic and guessing of which stocks are better than others.\n\nThe reason the index fund wins statistically is because it can be run by a simple automated set of rules \u2013 no need to pay $350M salaries to the hotshot traders running the \u201cAggressive growth fund\u201d down the street. Because there are millions of people, both smart and dumb, squabbling over the value of each stock, the Index Fund benefits and suffers from all the individual stock performances. But overall, you get the average performance of all this squabbling.\n\nIf you descend into the pit and try some squabbling yourself, you may come out ahead or drastically behind the average, but as it turns out, you can\u2019t predict in advance which squabblers (including yourself) will win and which will lose. All you can predict is that your average performance if you buy enough of these funds will be equal to the return of the market as a whole, minus the amount of fees your mutual fund charges. So by picking the index fund with the lowest fees, you automatically win. Endless statistical analysis proves this again and again. If you don\u2019t believe me, read the book \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street, or look up the topic of John Bogle \/ Bogleheads \/ and the foundation of the Vanguard company itself.\"","11":"Since we have <@U0F2WABLM> on board, I thought it would be a good idea with a finance channel for discussions. :simple_smile:","12":"<@U0F23JM99|andrew> has joined the channel","13":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","14":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","15":"<@U0F1V9D9A|rasmus> has joined the channel","16":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> has joined the channel","17":"<@U0F2WABLM|sorenschmidt> has joined the channel","18":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> has joined the channel","2":"Most of the major companies in the DAX index looks like great bargains.

On a somewhat unrelated note, what do you think about the future of bitcoin? Here\u2019s a relevant video which makes some good points about it and what could conceivably happen in the future. What do you think? <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1C5pk8wfCso&amp;feature=youtu.be>","8":"All of the points in the article are highly relevant and a major game changer in the market called \u201cinvestment banking\u201d.\nI would say that index fund\/tracker is a great asset for 95 % of the population. If you don\u2019t have the time\/ability to analyze investment prospect, you should stick to low fee index fund. The random walk is quite good in fact.  \nA lately rating from Morning Stars, points that 75 % of Danish investment funds underperform benchmark (which in fact are the index funds).\nSo I would be more then satisfied as an \u201cinvestor\u201d by holding index funds. \nBut\u2026.\nUnlike the rule above, there are some guys that keeps beating the market over time. ( I wanna joint that clan). Warren Buffett (the best investor ever) have been keen to talk about the topic on market efficiency (the random walk) and guys who actually conquer the market over decades. \nBuffett published a historical letter on this called:  \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\"  \n<http:\/\/www.tilsonfunds.com\/superinvestors.html> \nIf you want to know more about the philosophy (value-investing) I would be happy to talk :smile:","9":"Hi  <@U0F1WH8AZ>  sorry my late answer, i will return with a proper respond on this higly important conclusion, soon."}
