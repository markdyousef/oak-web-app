Upholding the ideals of wisdom, self-knowledge, courage and love of one's fellow man, he argued that the pursuit of virtue should be every individual's supreme goal.

By gaining insight into the nature of things, wisdom becomes complete and you realize the highest good. In apprehending the highest good, you can manifest sincerity. By manifesting sincerity, you rectify your heart and mind. By rectifying your heart and mind, you cultivate yourself. By cultivating yourself, you thereby guide your family.

I've read Suzuki's book though which is a masterpiece that I can highly recommend and would want to read again soon. ","11":"_In his book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, Zen master Shunryu Suzuki approaches the question of fast and slow learners in terms of horses. \"In our scrip- tures, it is said that there are four kinds of horses: excellent ones, good ones, poor ones, and bad ones. The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will, before it sees the shadow of the whip; the second best will run as well as the first one, just before the whip reaches its skin; the third one will run when it feels pain on its body; the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn to run._\n\n_\"When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. But this is a mistake\", Master Suzuki says. When you learn too easily, you're tempted not to work hard, not to penetrate to the marrow of a practice._\n\n_\"If you study calligraphy, you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art, and in life.\" The best horse, according to Suzuki, may be the worst horse. And the worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever it is practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones._\n\n_\"Suzuki's parable of the four horses has haunted me ever since I first heard it. For one thing, it poses a clear challenge for the person with exceptional tal- ent: to achieve his or her full potential, this person will have to work just as diligently as those with less innate ability\u201d_\n\n- Mastery\n\nAn excerpt from the book. Very inspirational stuff.","12":"Speaking of <#C0F1Z9TT9>, have any of you read this book *Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment*? (Link here:  <http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment\/dp\/0452267560>)\n\nHere\u2019s what the book is about: \"Drawing on Zen philosophy and his expertise in the martial art of aikido, bestselling author Gorge Leonard shows how the process of mastery can help us attain a higher level of excellence and a deeper sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in our daily lives.

In other words, what (if any) do you use to keep track of the tasks you need to do on a daily basis and generally organizing your work flow? If you use certain apps, which do you use? If you use pen and paper, how do you do it?
