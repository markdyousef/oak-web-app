Doshas are energies that are found throughout the the human body and mind. Similarly to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), each of the three doshas reflect elements. \n\n- Vata: *Ether and Air.* \n\nSome of its qualities: Dry, Light, Cold, Rough, Subtle, Mobile, Clear. \n\n- Pitta: *Fire and Water.* \n\nSome of its qualities: Oily, Sharp, Hot, Light, Mobile, Liquid. \n\n- Kapha: *Earth and Water*. \n\nSome of its qualities: Heavy, Slow, Cold, Oily, Slimy (smooth), Dense, Soft, Static (stable), Cloudy (sticky). \n\nSo in the Ayurvedic system, a person with a constitution of Vata has physical qualities that correspond to the Ether and the Air element. This will usually be reflected as: thin build, quick thinking, fast moving, hard to gain weight, low Agni (digestive fire) with low or irregular appetite and digestion, tendency to constipation and gas, emotional affective state leaning toward anxiety and fear, personality leaning towards vivacious, talkative, social and outgoing. \n\nA person with the Pitta constitution will have qualities reflective of Fire and Water elements, so here one will observe things like a fiery personality, high Agni (digestive fire) and quick digestion, oily skin, medium build, can gain weight but also lose weight equally easy, personality leaning towards being in control, intense, ambitious, and the negative affective state leaning toward jealousy and anger. \n\nA person with the Kapha constitution will have qualities reflective of Earth and Water elements, so here one will observe solid body frame, calm temperament, gains weight easily and hard to lose, slow digestion, personality leaning towards reserved, laid back, concerned, and negative affective state leaning toward posessive, greedy and withdrawn. \n\nWhile there is often one dosha in predominance according to this system based on bodily constitution, most people have a second dosha with strong influence. They refer to this as a dual-doshic constitution. \n\nSo for people still struggling with health and looking to optimize their health to their best ability and thus also increase their ability in meditation, I suggest taking a test such as <http:\/\/www.naturesformulary.com\/contents\/dosha-test> one and see if you have an excess of one of the doshas. If you do, I suggest trying a pacifying diet that corresponds to that dosha, and see if your health improves. \n\nI hope this post was helpful to some of you.","16":"Yeah, I know how you feel mate","17":"I\u2019m kinda pissed to be honest!

All I ask of people is to think about the actions they do, and contemplate the natural laws and thus, using logic and the intuitive wisdom, align themselves with their highest aspirations. I am by no means trying to preach a certain diet or certain lifestyle. I am simply trying to share a perspective that may provide ample food for thought (pun intended).","20":"I agree with what Mike is saying in the TED Talk, but unfortunately, while the initiative is in development, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the immediate change one can do on a personal scale is cut off consumption. That\u2019s up for each person to decide, and truly, with a multidimensional perspective, one may think it doesn\u2019t matter much. I mean, this is just one Earth, there are other Earths to go to, if need be, but that\u2019s not for the majority of people (people that do not cultivate nor reach enlightenment in this lifetime are destined to come back). So one may ask oneself about what the most compassionate choice would be. \n\nOf course, every person\u2019s diet requirement are different, and that\u2019s why it is difficult to suggest something like a Vegan or Vegetarian diet for everyone. \nThat is not feasible. There are some conditions that require various types of animal meat to function optimally. However, with the case of meat, there\u2019s not just the environmental impact that is questionable, there\u2019s also the known fact that meat takes more energy to process, it awakens the passions, and so forth. This is something that can be experienced when one increases one\u2019s sensitivity significantly, but as mentioned, some people need various substances to functional optimally.  \n\nI suggest you check out this fantastic resource called Healing with Whole Foods: <http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Healing-With-Whole-Foods-Traditions\/dp\/1556434308> \n\nWhen we think about things like GMO, GE seeds and plants, you will start to lose out on the benefits of the pranic supreme that exists within those plants. There are ways, not known to science yet, on how to measure bioenergetic potential of plants, vegetables, herbs, and so forth, and unfortunately, GMO does not provide the same bioenergetic potentials. Because of that, it can also lead to severe ramifications down the line in terms of cancerous growths, and various other destabilizations of internal cellular machinery. There\u2019s the unfortunate case where doctors in the 40-70s prescribed artificial Estrogen to postmenopausal women, and the ramifications were an increased incidence of breast cancer and thus overall mortality. This was of course not expected, but was found out, after-the-fact. \n\nCurrently, there\u2019s not just the problem of GMO, but also artificial sugars, countless carnicogens and lots of toxic substances that are added to most of the food we can buy today because of the increased use of pesticides and various toxic chemicals to increase the crop size.","21":"I believe incentives like this, vertical farming, GE seeds and plants, cultured meat(in-vitro meat) is the future of the human food-chain in large.

What I am referring to is related to physiological effects of kundalini, which is activated in very deep meditation. The breath meditation I\u2019ve just taught on <#C0F20Q1QE> increases Yin to the degree that Yang rises (kundalini). Said another way, in deep stillness, the power (of kundalini) arises. There\u2019s been some physiological elaborations on the kundalini both online <http:\/\/biologyofkundalini.com\/> &amp; <https:\/\/www.emergingsciences.org\/> but also in specific books such as Krishna Gopi\u2019s _Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man_ and C. G. Jung\u2019s _The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga._\n\nI will say, however, that it is folly to play around with the force of kundalini without knowing what one is doing. It is a highly righteous force, and is only released by those that are truly ready to accept and surrender to Its power. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to find many studies about people that only sleep between 2-5 hours outside of specific outliers that don\u2019t sleep at all.

You really can\u2019t go wrong with those sorts of basics. \n\nFor immune health, if you\u2019re worried about coming down with flu or the common cold, I can recommend EpiCor, which is a scientifically validated prebiotic that increases immune system activity. Besides that, the mushroom called Reishi Mushroom is extremely effective at improving general health and immune system activity. I\u2019d personally be taking it daily if it wasn\u2019t so expensive. \n\nIf you\u2019re more interested in muscular and athletic performance stuff, then stuff like BCAAs, Beta-Alanine, Creatine and D-Aspartic Acid will do you much good. \n\nFor manly health, testosterone levels and related, I\u2019ve heard some people have good results from Maca and cycling Tongkat Ali. \n\nFor cognitive performance - I thought I might as well mention it - lots of people love the L-Theanine\/Caffeine combination, so if you\u2019re already a coffee drinker, you may want to take a look into that. L-Theanine is the active component of Green Tea, and has a balancing effects on brain waves, increasing the alpha-waves in particular, which are associated with heightened mindfulness and relaxation. In a 2:1 ratio (200mg L-Theanine, 100mg caffeine), studies have found an improved response in terms of cognitive performance. If you wish, I can share you those studies, if it\u2019s something you want to pursue. \n\nSo, it really depends on your temperament, your goals, and ultimately, your desire for experimentation. \n\nDiet, exercise and a good amount of sleep will go a _long_ way, but when you have that in order, adding a few supplements here and there can really help your body perform at its optimum level (which is really just its natural level..). \n\nHope that helped! :simple_smile:","54":"Anders\/Mark: What would you recommend as a starter kit, due to supplements?","55":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","56":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","57":"Interesting.

I\u2019ve recently cycled  one of the compounds with CDP-choline for two weeks straight and then one week off.

I\u2019ve tried pretty much every racetam, but decided that they really provide me with no benefit, and if anything, makes my mood more erratic. Piracetam makes me hypomanic. Aniracetam feels psychedelic, but has strange metabolites that makes me feel derealized. Oxiracetam is speedy and crashy, like a caffeine buzz. And noopept, in particular, actually blunts my emotions. Great for cognitive work, but not for deepening the relationship with the Self &amp; Other.","60":"Fascinating review article on the nature and benefits of *Earthing* on the Human Body. \n\nTitle of the Paper: \"Earthing: Health Implications of Reconnecting the Human Body to the Earth\u2019s Surface Electrons\u201d. Link: <http:\/\/deltabed.no\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/jording_og_helse.pdf>\n\n*Conclusion:* _De Flora et al. wrote the following: \u201cSince the late 20th century, chronic degenerative diseases have overcome infectious disease as the major causes of death in the 21st century, so an increase in human longevity will depend on finding an intervention that inhibits the development of these diseases and slows their progress\u201d_\n\n_Could such an intervention be located right beneath our feet? Earthing research, observations, and related theories raise an intriguing possibility about the Earth\u2019s surface electrons as an untapped health resource\u2014the Earth as a \u201cglobal treatment table.\u201d Emerging evidence shows that contact with the Earth\u2014whether being outside barefoot or indoors connected to grounded conductive systems\u2014may be a simple, natural, and yet profoundly effective environmental strategy against chronic stress, ANS dysfunction, inflammation, pain, poor sleep, disturbed HRV, hypercoagulable blood, and many common health disorders, including cardiovascular disease. The research done to date supports the concept that grounding or earthing the human body may be an essential element in the health equation along with sunshine, clean air and water, nutritious food, and physical activity._ \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nI find this topic absolutely fascinating, because it is such a simple solution, yet profound effects are found from it. We\u2019ve found that a lot of day to day modern lifestyle diseases come from simply being _too_ stressed out. Well, they\u2019ve found out that the Earth actually protects you from that sort of thing, by forcing your body to activate more of the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest) activation instead of going amok in the sympathetic nervous system.  \n\nQuoting from relevant study under 2.4.1: _\u201cThe immediate decrease in SC indicates a rapid activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and corresponding deactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. The immediate increase in SC at cessation of grounding indicates an opposite effect. Increased RR, stabilization of BO, and slight rise in heart rate suggest the start of a metabolic healing response necessitating an increase in oxygen consumption.\u201d_\n\nSimply said: *awesome.* \n\nI should receive an Earthing device shortly, so I will most likely report back after a couple of week\u2019s usage.","61":"What a fascinating reported study.

There are a few stables, but I\u2019m really trying to listen to my body and mind towards what works and what doesn\u2019t work in different periods of my life. \n\u2022Creatine (Muscle creatine content, power output, hydration)\n\u2022BCAAs (Aerobic exercise, fat oxidation)\n\u2022Ginseng (anti-fatigue effects, subjective wellbeing, decrease in blood glucose)\n\u2022Ginkgo Bilopa (reducing risk of cognitive decline, increase in short term memory)\n\u2022Vitamin D (reducing risk of falls, increase testosterone, subjective health)\n\u2022Krill Oil, Omega 3 ( reduces stress, C-Reactive protein, blood pressure, depression and increases HDL-C and more)\n\u2022Vitamin B complex ( maintain nerves, regeneration of cells, protect against atherosclerosis)\n\u2022Turmeric - (anti-inflamatory, increase in antioxidant capacity\u2026)\n\u2022L-Theanine - (reducing stress, anxiety, and improving focus and sleep quality)\n\u2022Multivitamin - (general health benefits)\n\u2022Magnesium - (assist in ATP production)\n\u2022Vitamin C - ( increase glutathione - powerful antioxidant)\n\u2022Spirulina - (Alkalyzing, reducing allergies)\n\u2022Ketones\/ MCT - (increase midrocomdia function in the brain, processing speed, metabolic rate, working memory)\n\u2022Racetam  - (Increases oxygen levels in the brain and communication between left and right side of the brain.
