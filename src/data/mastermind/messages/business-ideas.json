The application works as a connected node in a (hopefully) bigger network with other connected node. By providing relevant information such as storage capacity, CPU power, bandwith etc. to the other peer connected devices the network, with use of algorithms, should be able to best distribute workload. I spoke with <@U0F1V9D9A> and apparently Sony and Google has used a similar concept for allocating power intensive computation related to protein bending. Apple on the other hand withdraw from this cooperation due to X (can remember the reason). I\u2019m not sure of the conclusion, but the platform provider has a huge saying in whether they want to allow such transaction to occur. And Apple is usually a bitch in this matter :laughing:","51":"<@U0F1ZMA72>:  What if you could rent out CPU power and storage during the night, when you don't use your devices and get paid for it, would you do it? Every person in the west has on average 2,4 connected actively connected devices. These devices aren't actively used during night, but often still connected. If we could utilise different time zones, the rapid growth of technology both in terms of bandwidth, computation power, etc. And the inclination towards shared economy we could build a distributed cloud network. A peer to peer system consisting of nodes in a network running programs that scale horizontally using existing but unused infrastructure. And the user is even getting paid for it. This could truly be the utilisation of technology. Is it possible <@U0F1V9D9A> <@U0F570U57> <@U0F23JM99> Airbnb for computation power :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \n\nI like the idea of utilizing excess\/un-used technology as well as Airbnb and newly started danish startup SpaceFlex, which is a peer-to-peer platform offering people to \"rent\" XX sqm for storage (basically Boxit in a peer-to-peer disguise). I truly believe that just as you can create a marketplace for excess of physical space you can do the exact same in more intangible areas. As long as the incentives are clear like the financial incentives you mentioned <@U0F1ZMA72>, then I believe the potential is huge - no doubt.  \n\nAre you thinking of an IoT network platform with smart nodes and nothing else - no third parties? Time zones as the determinator for availability (no. of online\/offline audience)? How exactly would you picture the setup of that peer-to-peer platform?","52":"&gt;In my opinion, the most valuable discussion appear when you are introduced to perspectives that you had not considered. A discussion between politicians might be interesting. However, it would probably become more interesting if experts from other professions contributed to the pool of knowledge. This process would presumably not appear as often on platforms that exclusively focus on a specific topic. I believe it would entail valuable synergies to gather inquisitive individuals from different professions and create appropriate settings in which they can share knowledge.\n\nAre we then sure that the written format is the best for such a form of discussion? There\u2019s lots of talks\/debates online where professionals in various positions discuss things from physics, to politics, and so forth. \n\n&gt;Another element, which is rather unique to this platform, is segmentation. I briefly touched upon in my previous message. As you mentioned, it might be difficult to start proper conversations on these difficult topics. For that reason, I believe that the platform should have some kind of appropriate access filter, which might be slightly dangerous. I am not particularly fond of the one-size-fit-all philosophy, which dominates the digital market of today. Instead of just creating a profile, maybe people should request admittance or somehow qualify for access. What do you think? How come we almost never see these mechanisms online?\n\nWell, as someone who is already a part of several invite-only groups, I think we do see it online, it\u2019s just not advertised, because of the same reason you listed; namely that they use appropriate filters that only makes the target audience pursue the goal of enrolment, so to speak, in the first place. So to that end, I think it\u2019s a fine idea, and it\u2019s something that is already being used through various channels. \n\n&gt; For that reason, I think it would be interesting to see dialogues where an actual conclusion is not necessarily needed. Perhaps philosophical questions might be too difficult to discuss since they apparently can only be understood on a level beyond thoughts. However, I believe that that assertion would constitute a very good foundation for a constructive discussion. I am confident that discussions would emerge naturally when curious people are gathered. \n\nI certainly agree. Oh, and just because self-realization and true sanity cannot happen within an obstructed thinking consciousness (perhaps see the recent video I posted on <#C0F20Q1QE> to get a grasp on what I mean by that), that doesn\u2019t mean that the pursuit of philosophy shouldn\u2019t be encouraged, because as the Ancients used to say, Philosophy is by its very nature the search for Truth. However, what the Ancients realized, and what contemporary philosophers are unfortunately not, is that the without going beyond the fetters of the ego, there can be no clear vision of what truth entails. So, yes to that end, moving from a state of opinion (doxia) to knowledge (gnosis) would be very difficult without proper guidance. \n\n&gt; I am very fascinated by the constellation of Etisk R\u00e5d. Here you can find a page with a prevention of their members: <http:\/\/www.etiskraad.dk\/raadets-medlemmer> (sorry the page is only available in Danish)\n\nYes, I am aware of them, and they do some absolutely great work for sure. As a side note, why would it being Danish be a problem for me? You think I forgot how to read Danish after reading too much English? :stuck_out_tongue: \n\nOverall, I think it\u2019s a great idea if one could find a proper outlet for it \u2014 as you say, we need a design that could tailor to the format of discussion you wish to cultivate within the borders of the Site. That\u2019s where more creative thinking is needed, and also, a proper understanding and perhaps emulation of conversations\/discussions is needed, in order to fully grasp how it would function.","53":"Thank you for sharing your valuable knowledge Anders! Very interesting and challenging questions. Questions containing elements that I have not thought about.\nFirstly, I would like to stress the fact that this idea is not something revolutionary - neither with respect to setup or technology (at least not initially). In my opinion, it is more an incremental improvement of existing solutions, which I genuinely believe is necessary. It is therefore difficult to emphasise elements that explicitly differentiate the platform from existing platforms. However, I believe that the platforms you mentioned have two profound drawbacks in addition to their visually unattractive and uninteresting appearance, which this idea might be able to comply with.\nThe fact that these platforms are centred around specific topics might seem convenient. However, personally I would hate to switch between different websites depending on which topic I would like to discuss. Moreover, I am not fond of blindly delimiting subjects from eachother this dramatically since I believe that they are somehow interrelated, which takes me to my second point. One of the absolute core values of this idea is that by gathering numerous topics we obtain the potential of accumulating knowledge from different areas. Knowledge that should be distributed through different channels. In my opinion, the most valuable discussion appear when you are introduced to perspectives that you had not considered. A discussion between politicians might be interesting. However, it would probably become more interesting if experts from other professions contributed to the pool of knowledge. This process would presumably not appear as often on platforms that exclusively focus on a specific topic. I believe it would entail valuable synergies to gather inquisitive individuals from different professions and create appropriate settings in which they can share knowledge.\nAnother element, which is rather unique to this platform, is segmentation. I briefly touched upon in my previous message. As you mentioned, it might be difficult to start proper conversations on these difficult topics. For that reason, I believe that the platform should have some kind of appropriate access filter, which might be slightly dangerous. I am not particularly fond of the one-size-fit-all philosophy, which dominates the digital market of today. Instead of just creating a profile, maybe people should request admittance or somehow qualify for access. What do you think? How come we almost never see these mechanisms online?\nHonestly, I have not really thought about the format of the potential dialogues. I just do not see a need for another encyclopaedia, where factual questions can be answered without any form of actual dialogue. For that reason, I think it would be interesting to see dialogues where an actual conclusion is not necessarily needed. Perhaps philosophical questions might be too difficult to discuss since they apparently can only be understood on a level beyond thoughts. However, I believe that that assertion would constitute a very good foundation for a constructive discussion. I am confident that discussions would emerge naturally when curious people are gathered. \nI am very fascinated by the constellation of Etisk R\u00e5d. Here you can find a page with a prevention of their members: <http:\/\/www.etiskraad.dk\/raadets-medlemmer> (sorry the page is only available in Danish). They discuss numerous ethical issues and give advice to everything from powerful businessmen to experienced politicians. They do not always reach unambiguous conclusion but I am sure that they discussions are rewarding.","54":"Hey Andrew. Glad to see you around here!\n\nWell, my immediate reaction would be: Isn\u2019t that what forums are for? I know forums in neuroscience\/mind-stuff, like <http:\/\/brainmeta.com\/forum\/>, I know forums for politics, like <http:\/\/www.politicalforum.com\/> &amp; <http:\/\/www.debatepolitics.com\/>, I know forums for economics and so on and so forth. My question would be, how is your platform different than a simple forum setup?\n\nMy next question would be related to your notion of intellectual debate. For instance, according to Socratic dialogue, dialectic reasoning would be the only way of truly coming to actual conclusions and proper discussions about various subjects (see e.g.  Alcibiades) \u2014 what format for dialogue would you use? Would you use an expert panel that would start the conversation, and then let \u201clay\u201d subscribers interact with said experts in selected areas? \n\nSince you mentioned ethical and philosophical questions, I\u2019d then also perhaps say that things like that are difficult to discuss, maybe not because there\u2019s not a truth, but perhaps because that Truth can only be understood above the level of thoughts. Here I am particularly talking about a higher level of consciousness that actually has insight into why certain actions give certain outcomes, that cannot immediately be gauged by logic. \n\nOf course, a platform that delves into these things would be great, but I am afraid that it would require a very select target group of writers, because without people that can properly construct arguments and structures of logical thought, it would be difficult to start a conversation on such difficult topics without it eventually going into a circle-jerk (to use modern nomenclature) or rhetorical nonsense. \n\nJust some food for thought.","55":"Naturally, there are numerous unanswered questions. How are we able to control the content when the platform is driven by the audience itself? How do we target inquisitive individuals without cynically expelling others that appear incompetent? How is it actually possible to target the \u201cright\u201d people? Is it possible to obtain the required network effects to facilitate the idea when it is not a mass-market platform? Is it even possible to make people understand the difference between this idea and other \u201csubstitutes\u201d? I do not have the right answer to all of these questions. Actually, I do not have the right answer to any of these questions. That is why I am really curious to know what you think. Personally, I would really enjoy experiencing such a world of knowledge comprised of numerous different perspectives without being annoyed by distracting features and commercials.","56":"Hi everyone! \nThe other day I experienced something that has not net left my mind since and I would like to share my thoughts with you. I was sitting at my desk studying something totally irrelevant. For that reason, I did something that almost everybody does nowadays. I found my smartphone and opened Facebook. After browsing my news feed for a few minutes I found an unusually interesting article. The topic of the article is insignificant for now, however, after reading the article l had a profound need to articulate my position on the topic. I read the comments and what I found was that almost all of the comments were either frivolous or out of rhetorical reach. Only very few comments contained rational and deliberate arguments. Therefore, I did not leave a comment. As I see it, it would have been totally useless anyway. Afterwards, I started to think about the experience. \nI opened Slack, which to me is a highly effective communicational tool. However, it has a serious drawback. The communication almost exclusively takes place in pre-existing networks, which in most cases dramatically limits the diversity of the communication. One could argue that it is the opposite deficiency of the one that I experienced on Facebook. \nSubsequently, I did some research on intellectual fora. With the help of my brother, I found numerous interesting platforms (e.g. Medium and Quora) that I had never heard of before. Many of them approached difficult and complex topics, which I found very interesting. The tone was polite and professional and it was genuinely a satisfying experience. However, what I found was that the objectives of these platforms were to answer questions rather than spark discussions. Furthermore, the quality of their content gradually degrades as they become more commercial.\nToday, passionate debates and academic conversations are gradually replaced by digital information gathering and fact collection. Nevertheless, ethic issues and philosophical questions still exist. What would you think of an online platform that encourages intellectual debate about subjects that can not be answered by search engines and encyclopaedias? A platform driven by curious audience where everything from literature and ethics to economics and politics are discussed? The platform should be targeted exclusively towards inquisitive individuals that are able to contribute constructively. The objective is to create an \u201cuniverse\u201d of knowledge based upon interactive dialogue rather than the partial monologue that characterises the media of today.","57":"Ohh yeah, btw I don\u2019t have the slightest idea of how to utilize the idea I wrote about, technically :stuck_out_tongue: Whether iOS or Android allow apps to consume that much CPU, bandwith, memory, etc.","58":"I was thinking more about the logistic setup of the business from the customers perspective :simple_smile: Seems like a really good idea. I believe the barriers to entry in the medical business are being lowered by technology and services like this seems like an awesome way to initiate, build trust and grow.","59":"Not really, <@U0F1ZMA72>. 23andme offers genetic SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) correlation results, and ancestry results. Their SNP data can also be run through second-hand parties like Prometheus to find more correlations on significant polymorphisms. The business I had in mind would solely be focused on blood, hair and stool-analysis, and possibly also food-allergy testing through blood markers. That would be along with, if that package was chosen, an in-depth clinical check-up that tests one\u2019s VO2 max (respiratory efficiency), fasting blood glucose levels and various other things, for optimization purposes.","6":"","60":"Sounds awesome. A service a bit like 23andme it seems? ","61":"A business idea that I contemplated in the past, that I was just reminded of with my private messages with <@U0F21G8VD>, was to create a consumer-based health analytics company. There would be an outpatient clinic where patients could have their blood drawn, and hair- and stool analysis kits could be sent through mail. The samples would be sent  with overnight delivery to respective labs for the testing of various biological markers with known disease and longevity correlations. Results should be possible to reach within 3 days through an online site. The online site would also provide a listing of various health packages that could be selected, such as one that would include an analysis of blood and hair, and subsequently provide detailed explanations for the markers and their associated risks and known correlations, and then provide, as per longevity or on an optimization level, extensive supplemental\/herbal regime recommendations.","62":"Sounds like a cool idea <@U0F1ZMA72>. Would love to hear more about the tech-side of things from that perspective. Could you elaborate on how something like that could be done?","63":"<@U0KL1MXC5|abedkreidly> has joined the channel","64":"What if you could rent out CPU power and storage during the night, when you don't use your devices and get paid for it, would you do it?

Is it possible to use that to proactively help solve the problem? It seems (I don't watch the news, so I ain't sure) that distribution of people is the main problem. Historically, e.g. Denmark has demanded certain immigrants to come and work in Denmark while Germany has demanded others. This might sound a little cynical, but what if we can use mobile technology and big data to help refugees to end up the right place in accordance with societal benefits? Hence matching refugee competence with societal needs. (Hypothetically) Greece needs more doctors, Germany more labour for their car industry, so allocating refugees based on this instead randomly might help...","78":"A little insight into Mr. Page's mind. \n\nLarry Page, Google Founder, Is Still Innovator in Chief\n<http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/24\/technology\/larry-page-google-founder-is-still-innovator-in-chief.html>","79":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","8":"","80":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","81":"Great and concise interview with one of the greatest tech leaders of our time: <http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/22\/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-on-where-big-tech-is-headed\/>","82":"<@U0F1WH8AZ|anderskassem> has joined the channel","83":"<@U0F2WABLM|sorenschmidt> has joined the channel","84":"Golden nuggets from the Valley\u2019s finest and brightest minds!","85":"Awesome lectures held at Stanford by the world\u2019s most renown incubator yCombinator:  <http:\/\/startupclass.samaltman.com\/>","86":"<@U0F23JM99|andrew> has joined the channel","87":"<@U0F1V9D9A|rasmus> has joined the channel","88":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> set the channel purpose: generating business ideas for a changing world by discussing trends, ideas, concepts, thoughts, experience and share knowledge.","89":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> set the channel purpose: discuss trends, ideas, concepts, thoughts, experience and share knowledge with the purpose of creating business ideas.","9":"","90":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> set the channel purpose: The purpose of this channel is to discuss trends, ideas, concepts, thoughts, experience and share knowledge with the purpose of creating business ideas.","91":"<@U0F1ZMA72|mark> has joined the channel"}
