Eventually they\u2019ll have to come to grips with the fact that materialism is metaphysically incongruent.","10":"I completely agree. There\u2019s definitely need for innovation in this area on how to provide something similar to proper quality control for journals. Unfortunately, there\u2019s currently the need for prestige, and often, the prestige then attracts the best scientists to the editorial boards of various journals. Hopefully, one can think out a system with time, that can maintain the high standard of publication.","11":"This is actually a very interesting subject!\nThe problem with the publishing system today, is that is also used as a ranking system to compare scientists, there are better publishers than other. This comes from a long line of culture and traditions, which does not really fit into our world of open-source beliefs and mindsets.\nIndeed the scientists does not get paid, but neither does the editors (the people deciding whether the article should be approve for a given publisher). So the only people earning money from this, is the publisher. In Denmark we even pay scientists, very well, for doing this research, but if we would like to read it, we would have to pay for it, again. Furthermore, Universities in Denmark pay huge amount of money to these publishers, to access their archives.\nIt would be extremely hard to change his old system as it is, if it were to be done, it would have to be at some level which would force or push every scientist in the world. An example could be the UN taking over the storage and ranking of this.\nAll in all, it is very nice seeing that this subject has started getting some attention and hopefully start a movement in the right direction.","12":"I\u2019m very happy to see something like this happening. I agree, science should be free for all. To those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not even scientists that are getting the cut, it\u2019s the publishing companies.

It depends on whether it could make astral and etheric bodies, and that would depend on some form of consciousness higher up the hierarchy. I don\u2019t exactly understand how technology would interface with the spiritual realms. As far as I understood, our human bodies are created from the divine template, and therefore have etheric and astral bodies which allow the interface between the dimensions. The entire universe is expressed in our body. This is what\u2019s known as the macrocosm exists in the microcosm. Whether that would be the case for a technological entity, I honestly don\u2019t know. I really doubt it, since it would be constrained by the physical laws that rule it \u2014 but then again, if, as you said it is not constrained because it\u2019s self-evolving, then\u2026 god knows. It may be able to figure out the cosmic\/metaphysical laws that exist on the spiritual planes, and then use that to its advantage. It would become an intense egregore, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nIt\u2019s very interesting to think about.","41":"Great point! Maybe I\u2019m a little pessimistic, but initially we\u2019ll be creating a conscious (being). As we know, if you are self-contious you\u2019ll want to better yourself and ensure your survival, and this is the point where things might take a turn. I really don\u2019t think we can compare this to nations, military or corporations competing on making the best motor og even an atomic bomb and whoever is in control wins the race. Once succeeding in creating a self-contious artificial mind it will want to grow and expand by digesting the internet, etc. This is not a biological being constrained by evolutionary means!! What if this \u2018thing\u2019 becomes so powerful and figures out how to use nanotechnology all at once and how to use to manipulate every atom to it\u2019s benefit - it might better it probability of surviving and flourish afterall (and btw we\u2019re also made of atoms)\u2026 Yeah I know, it\u2019s a little dark, but in all seriousness \u2013 this is not something we get 99,99% right and fix later. If this goes wrong we\u2019re fucked and if it goes right well\u2026 \nBut still we\u2019re \u2018only\u2019 taking about one dimension of intelligence and the physical world, I wonder how it will influence the spiritual world (for those of us who believe in such a thing). Maybe we\u2019ll rather be companions with AI because it understands the aspect of souls, multiple dimensions, etc\u2026","42":"I do agree, AI will absolutely be used by the Military, as it already is. We are however, still far from an uncontrollable artificial superintelligence, and my best guess is that we will continue to be for a long time.\n\nBut imagine we had an uncontrollable artificial superintelligence today, it will would still not be able to eradicate human existence directly. It would however be able to crash a couple of internet connected cars (and roombas), but the more efficient way would probably be to take down all the banks and leave the world to chaos or play a couple of superpower nations against each other. In both scenarios, we would be the one to destroy ourselves, which we are pretty good at on our own. Above could just as well be caused by human hackers, rather than an AI.\n\nBack on subject, I do think that AI my solve bunch of problems, but it will absolutely also help create a lot. And with all technologies, it is just a matter of time.","43":"To be honest I think it is not the technology that we should be scared of, but we should be scared of ourselves. There's no limit to what we can do and let technology do for us. So I totally agree with <@U0F1WH8AZ>.","44":"<@U0F570U57>: and <@U0F1V9D9A> I would love to hear your points of view on the above...","45":"It\u2019s a good question. \n\nI don\u2019t know of enough specifics or have delved enough into the subject matter, to really discuss whether it is a foreseeable consequence of AI technology that it would evolve to such a degree that we are not capable of controlling it. \n\nWhat frightens me currently more is that it appears that as soon as great technologies are created and great knowledge has been found, there will always be people that want to use that power for something nefarious. \n\nWe can see this all over the world today. We have so much technological and scientific knowledge to solve so many problems in today\u2019s society, yet the Military Industrial complex is fueling a War Machine that is profiteering from wars instigated throughout the world.  \n\nSo my question will simply be. Will it be worth it creating such a technology and then letting it get into the wrong hands? Because surely, it is a matter of resources. And if anything, an AI would certainly help with geopolitical issues of accruing more resources and detailing planned invasions taking into account all kinds of data that human beings wouldn\u2019t be as capabale of. It would be _the_ greatest weapon for attaining power \u2014 at least in theory. \n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no safe-line for human ego and ignorance. There are certain currents that is helping us move a certain direction, but that same current is also causing upheavals, as it forces people to make choices based on fear or love. Do we stand together, or do we stand alone and fight whomeever may come and, from our perspective, threaten us? \n\nYou can observe this just after the Paris Attacks. People are immediately retaliating. That\u2019s not a choice from wisdom, it\u2019s a choice made from ignorance. \n\nDoes a child that has hit another child with a stick in the playground, go get another stick and then goes around hitting everyone with it? No, you remove the stick and you found out who sold that stick to begin with, and stop that. \n\nSolve the cause, not the symptoms. \n\nI could of course be completely wrong, and an AI may solve all our problems. I just don\u2019t see that scenario as very likely.  :simple_smile:","46":"btw. from a critical standpoint the authors and viewholders are all \u2018scientifically\u2019 deducing the issues from a narrow standpoint. Some of us believe in something bigger not comprehensible by science (God, the universe, love, etc.) is this a safeline? Not saying that a Superintelligence in a rational matter couldn\u2019t be dangerous, but shouldn\u2019t we consider more then just intellect when speaking about intelligence (in lack of a better word)?","47":"<!channel>:  I\u2019ve recently read some books (\u2018Our Final Invention\u2019 and \u2018The Second Machine Age\u2019 just to name a few) that takes a rather pessimistic view on the rapid development and soon realization of Artificial Intelligence. Problems like \u2018The Busy Child\u2019, \u2018The Intelligence Explosion\u2019 and more that stems from the fact that computers doesn\u2019t have the same capacity boundaries a humans are highlighted and culminates in the question: If we develop an Artificial Superintelligence, why should it obey us? And if it\u2019s trying to solve an optimization problem why shouldn\u2019t it just utilize the atoms we\u2019re composed of more effectively (in it\u2019s view)? So do you guys thing we should be scared and really do some practical measures to avoid this reality? How?","48":"Haha I know. I'm sorry I forgot to mention that..

I also recommend to use Python instead of R for data science, not because R is \"bad\", but because Python  can be used in other fields (Web Dev, games, API programming etc.) in contrast to R. All three languages mentioned here have helpful communities. In my opinion Python better than most language because it has the sklearn module <http:\/\/scikit-learn.sourceforge.net\/stable\/index.html> that contains all the algos used in ML. \nThe thing with Machine Learning is that you want to apply the models they teach you as soon as possible on \"real\" data (e.g. movie reviews, try the UCI repository for data <http:\/\/archive.ics.uci.edu\/ml\/datasets.html>), else the models may become a bit too abstract. I read the book by Peter Flach: \"Machine Learning: The art and science of algorithms  that make sense of data\", this book actually needs a lecturer because there's no application of the algorithms. Therefore,  I also did some excercises of the book: \"Building Machine Learning systems with Python\". Usually, in Machine Learning the big distinction is supervised\/unsupervised learning and feature extraction which will get you very far. Once you grasp those concepts in all their glory, you can move on to deep learning and factorisation.","53":"<@U0F570U57>: I\u2019m thinking about diving a little bit into Machine Learning, Data analysis and hopefully AI.
