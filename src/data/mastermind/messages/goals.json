","21":"High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)","22":"Absolutely <@U0F1ZMA72> and indeed, Napolean Hill actually directly emphasizes brahmachayara, sexual retention. Tesla was celibate since his late 20s as he cultivated the deep samadhis and knew that the sexual essence is important for the cultivation of mental and physical well-being. For males that do not meditate, the essence is not as important, and having ejaculation between 4-7 times per week is okay according to the Taoists, but if you meditate and use those energies inwardly, it is generally recommended to either abstain completely or do twice per month. It builds the internal repertoire of power. Godspeed gentlemen. ","23":"I relation to Anders' description of auto-suggestion and the post' emphasis on goal-setting and obsession. I would recommend everyone to read 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napolean Hill (this is one of the books I recommended to you <@U0F21G8VD>). Though the focus on attaining material wealth (so people can relate) it works for any desire. It's a practical guide to unleashing the law of attraction - a universal law just as gravity, electromagnetism... It's a must read! ","24":"<!channel> I really liked this post on goal-setting. I hope you others may find it helpful as well for whatever your goals may be: <https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/getdisciplined\/comments\/33jijb\/method_a_goalsetting_fix_that_will_transform_your\/>\n\nI usually keep mental tabs on my goals, but I will begin writing them down daily in the manner expressed. It may give a bit more oomph to the transformation. Obsession used productively is a great thing. \n\nIn NLP and spiritual transformational systems, we use something similar that\u2019s called auto-suggestion. Before sleep, every night, you choose a particular idea you would like to impress upon your unconscious systems. It could, \u201cI am healthy\u201d, or \u201cI am happy\u201d, or \u201cI accomplish my goals\u201d, and you repeat that phrase 40 repetitions at least before you fall asleep. You do this every night, and when you wake up in the morning, you start your day with that. As you find the impregnation being succesful, you can then change it to something else, but give it at least a month or so for obvious changes to occur. This goes very well with meditation because it allows the link between conscious and unconscious mind to increase. More energy will be readily available. If you have questions regarding auto-suggestion, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. I will make a full post on it, should it be wanted\/desired.","25":"@soufyan Ah right! My bad.

But for others, it may suffice, but I\u2019ll post this here, since you mentioned it, and may find it interesting.  _\u201cThe winter, being a time of barrenness for nature, is not an ideal time for new resolutions, and truly, people rarely keep to them. The spring is when the earth receives its new influx of energy from the sun, and this equinox is the ideal time to bring in the new year with spiritual celebration and inspiration. Specifically, it is a time marked by a certain phase of the moon following the spring equinox, for all magical calendars must take into account both the sun and the moon. All four seasonal intervals are a good time for fire rituals: the fire rituals in winter are to support the kalva (time of retreat) and the burning of obstacles, and the fire ritual of the spring equinox is to support the prayers and new years resolutions made on that day, similar to how old traditions might sacrifice an animal before a grand voyage\u201d_","31":"<!channel>:","32":"<@U0F570U57|soufyanbelkaid> has joined the channel","33":"<@U0F21G8VD|max> has joined the channel","34":"I hope everyone started 2016 on a highnote and are ready to the challenges and lessons to come.

Simply because the odds of improving the world is better if  I myself am better. For me, this improvement comes from diving further into the spiritual realm of the universe to experience, comprehend and understand things as they truly are, but may be cluttered due to societal influence and a limited mind. It comes from dedication and hard work towards improving crafts as electrical engineering, data science and software engineering, which I believe can help facilitate solutions to big problems.
