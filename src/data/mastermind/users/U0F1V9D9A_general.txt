"Absolutely! Hi, my name is Rasmus Faddersbøll, I’m currently working as a software developer at Woerk (with Mark). Primarily my job is to create mobile applications and backend servers, all while finding new technologies to explore and a better way to use the tools currently in use.
My greatest motivator in life is, and has always been, curiosity. If I am curios about something, I have a very hard time putting it down, this is sometimes a weakness too.
Because we, unfortunately, are limited to a 24 day and we need sleep, I am always trying to find diffrent ways to get the most out of the day.
While I am fascinated by other things, such as health, finance and meditation, due to time limitations, I am keeping my focus on technology and likely some entrepreneur related areas later on."
