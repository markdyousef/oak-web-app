"Indeed a devastating industry! I  have been wondering how this can be regulated and improved. In my experience the Danish food industry (e.g. Danish Crown) have been ""showing"" interest in Open Innovation - exploiting new sustainable technology but for some reason it often ends up being talk without no real action. Guess the technology already being accesible, could governments demand their use? Another thing is the obvious food waste problem. Why dont they simply just produce less food?

"I was stunned to see how many major environmental groups failed to address this issue (basically ignoring its existence)- from the Cowspiracy Movie. However, luckily the Danish version of <http://www.meatfreemondays.com/> received somewhat rather heavy media exposure yesterday! 
- I am a full supporter of in-vitro meat as a long-term solution though."
