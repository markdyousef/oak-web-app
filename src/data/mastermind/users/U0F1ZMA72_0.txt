"Master Plan, Part Deux

Hi Anders I’ve send you a new invite to <mailto:anderskassem@gmail.com|anderskassem@gmail.com>. Yeah the formatting is bit strange due to a plugin we use (Elegantt) for project management :confused:
"<!channel>: I’ve created a Trello board and integrated it to Slack. I have invited you to travel - check your email, such that you can access the board. This will hopefully function as a creative canvas for business ideas. I have and will continue to add some of the business ideas we intend to work on. Please critique and comment on these and add your own :smile:"

"I was thinking of a somehow naive setup, where the user gets the application and allows it to be used during idle hours. The application works as a connected node in a (hopefully) bigger network with other connected node. By providing relevant information such as storage capacity, CPU power, bandwith etc. to the other peer connected devices the network, with use of algorithms, should be able to best distribute workload. I spoke with <@U0F1V9D9A> and apparently Sony and Google has used a similar concept for allocating power intensive computation related to protein bending. Apple on the other hand withdraw from this cooperation due to X (can remember the reason). I’m not sure of the conclusion, but the platform provider has a huge saying in whether they want to allow such transaction to occur. And Apple is usually a bitch in this matter :laughing:"
"Ohh yeah, btw I don’t have the slightest idea of how to utilize the idea I wrote about, technically :stuck_out_tongue: Whether iOS or Android allow apps to consume that much CPU, bandwith, memory, etc."
"I was thinking more about the logistic setup of the business from the customers perspective :simple_smile: Seems like a really good idea. I believe the barriers to entry in the medical business are being lowered by technology and services like this seems like an awesome way to initiate, build trust and grow."
Sounds awesome. A service a bit like 23andme it seems? 
"What if you could rent out CPU power and storage during the night, when you don't use your devices and get paid for it, would you do it? Every person in the west has on average 2,4 connected actively connected devices. These devices aren't actively used during night, but often still connected. If we could utilise different time zones, the rapid growth of technology both in terms of bandwidth, computation power, etc. And the inclination towards shared economy we could build a distributed cloud network. A peer to peer system consisting of nodes in a network running programs that scale horizontally using existing but unused infrastructure. And the user is even getting paid for it. This could truly be the utilisation of technology. Is it possible <@U0F1V9D9A> <@U0F570U57> <@U0F23JM99> Airbnb for computation power :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: "
:ok_hand:
"I really don't know how the governments do. But it doesn't seem to be working. For my states it seems a burden to house refugees. If you could limit that by sending the right refugees to the state, maybe that burden could be reduced. I'm thinking it should work as a digital passport... Then I really didn't thought more about it. This might be an easier problem to solve for Facebook, Google or someone with access to this sought of data :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"
I'm not speaking about governmental actions. 
We should start this by building a platform for such? 
I'm aware it doesn't solve the problem entirely. But we have to start somewhere. 
"<!channel>: it's my dad birthday today and at the birthday dinner the refugee problems where discussed. Everyone, even the refugees has a smartphone. Is it possible to use that to proactively help solve the problem? It seems (I don't watch the news, so I ain't sure) that distribution of people is the main problem. Historically, e.g. Denmark has demanded certain immigrants to come and work in Denmark while Germany has demanded others. This might sound a little cynical, but what if we can use mobile technology and big data to help refugees to end up the right place in accordance with societal benefits? Hence matching refugee competence with societal needs. (Hypothetically) Greece needs more doctors, Germany more labour for their car industry, so allocating refugees based on this instead randomly might help..."
