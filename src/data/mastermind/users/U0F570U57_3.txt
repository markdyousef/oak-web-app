"@ anderskassem Habibi, I should've been more clear, I was referring to the sun, since there's been a lot of sunshine the past couple of weeks. I wish I had a new influx of energy from the sun :simple_smile:"
"<!channel>: I've never committed to any resolutions, nor have I ever made any. I've been in southern Spain for the past two weeks, with a lot of sun.. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I have had an influx of energy, though the vibes are still good as usual. I guess I'll just continue the way I am, happythankyoumoreplease :simple_smile:"
