"Hello everyone. My name is Max Kristensen and I'm currently studying Mechatronics Engineering on 3th Semester in SÃ¸nderborg Denmark. Our focus is to combine mechanics, electronics and software, for instance this semester, we are building autonomous vehicles with focus on analog circuit design. Dedicated and helpful, would be the two best word to describe me, as a person. Since I moved to this small town in Denmark away from friends and family, I was finally able to find myself and it is now clear to me what i want to do with my life."
