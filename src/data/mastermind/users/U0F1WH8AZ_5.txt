"In a similar way, if negative emotions present themselves to you in meditation or in your daily life, you should acknowledge them. You can imagine emotions like very dense thoughts; emotions usually accompany thoughts, or thoughts accompany emotions. You simply notice and see that these emotions are there. But you don’t do anything else about them. Instead, you let them go. This letting go of them is the same process as “forgiveness” and “love”. Let them go, forgive yourself. They are _not_ you. How can they be you when you are the one witnessing these things; how can they be you when they are impermanent, they rise and fall?  

The problem with suppressing the emotions is that you simply drive the emotion deeper into your subconscious. You might consciously distract yourself but there is this nagging feeling that remains unresolved. You need to look at the emotion, acknowledge it and then forgive yourself regardless of any reason. This is what some religions call _confession of one’s sins_."

"I’ll here upload a chapter from Sadhguru’s new book _Inner Engineering_, as I feel it pertains as motivation for those that have yet to understand the purpose of the true spiritual journey, without doctrines, precepts. Just being hinted at pure experience."
"""Successive thoughts do not stop; prior thoughts, present thoughts, and future thoughts follow one after the other without cessation. If one instant of thought is cut off, the Dharma body separates from the physical body, and in the midst of successive thoughts there will be no place for attachment to anything. If one instant of thought clings, then successive thoughts cling; this is known as being fettered. If in all things successive thoughts do not cling, then you are unfettered. Therefore, non-abiding is made the basis of [true spiritual practice]”  

~ Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of Zen"
"Some inspiration perhaps — 

""When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world.

I found it was difficult to change the world, so I tried to change my nation. When I found I couldn't change the nation, I began to focus on my town. I couldn't change the town and as an older man, I tried to change my family.

Now, as an old man, I realize the only thing I can change is myself, and suddenly I realize that if long ago I had changed myself, I could have made an impact on my family. My family and I could have made an impact on our town. 

Their impact could have changed the nation and I could indeed have changed the world.""

"The idea, instead, is not to focus on the thoughts, but watching them pass-by. Imagine yourself like a CCTV camera, watching people walk by. In the same way, you witness your thoughts and know they are there, but you just simply watch them come and go like drifting clouds. Instead of the thoughts, focus on the spaces between the thoughts.

One should not try to resist the thought, as mentioned. One should let them be what they want to be, but do not feed them extra attention. Do not indulge in the thought and make it grow. Instead, recognize that you are the witness, the watcher, the awareness that sees these thoughts appear and disappear, and _not_ the thoughts themselves. This is the process of _non-dwelling_."

"""Their components are remarkbly similar in all cultures on all continents and in all times. While containing numerous variations, themes, and differences, they do have a basic framework that is very similar in a number of areas. Most assert the following: 

1. At the center of all things is spirit. In other words, there is a central underlying unifying force in the Universe that is sacred in nature. 
2. All matter is made from this substance. In other words, the sacred manifests itself in physical form. 
3. Because all matter is made frmo the sacred, all things posssess a soul, a sacred intelligence, or _logos_. 
4. Because human beings are generated out of this same substance, it is possible for human beings to communicate with the soul or intelligence in all other matter and for those intelligences to communicate with human beings. 
5. Human beings were ignorant when they arrived here, and the powers of the Earth and the various intelligences in all things began to teach them how to be human. This is still true. It is not possible for new generations to become human without this communication or reatching from the natural world. 
6. Parts of the Earth can manifest more or less sacredness, just like human beings. A human being can never know when some part of the Earth might be expressing deep levels of sacredness or begin talking to him or here. Therefore, it is important to cultivate attentiveness of mind. 
7. Human beings are only one of the many life-forms of the Earth, neither more nor less important than the others. Failure to remember this can be catastrophic for individuals, nations and peoples. “

Excerpt from the book: *The Transformational Power of Fasting* by Stephen Harbour Buhner."
"""There is an old native american observation that when the white man took tabocca back to the Old World he merely took its body - its spirit was left in North America, lying on the ground. Tobacco, for ancient peoples, was considered a holy plant, a plant with great spiritual powers, whose purpose was to facilitate communication between human beings and the sacred powers of the Earth and the Universe. This same dynamic, the splitting apart of the body and the spirit of a thing, has occurred with a great many other things that have always been considered intrinsically spiritual in nature. Fasting is one of them. 

For the past five hundred years the trend has been, increasingly, to view matter as devoid of spirit, intelligence, soul, or purpose. A lump of rock — merely inanimate matter, a resource or something on which to stub your toe, certainly not something filled with soul. But throughout human history, human cultural perspectives about such things have been very different. In earlier times, it was commonly understood, irrespective of culture or historical period, that the world was alive, that all things possessed souls, that human beings were only one of a multitude of ensouled beings, and that there was a constant soul energy going out of and into our bodies as we traveled through the world. Beyond any health aspects it was known to posess, fasting, like tobacco, was one way, an important way, to deepen communication with the sacred. Fasting, it was recognized, increased human sensitivity to the nonmaterial world, enhanced personal experience of the sacredness of both self and Universe, and helped the fasting person regain a sense of orientation and purpose. 

Compared to the mechanistic worldview that is now so dominant, oler perspectives of the Universe are much more complex and multidimensional. Ancient and nonindustrial cultures understood that the Universe and the Earth were deeply sacred. Human beings, along with all other life-forms, are, within those earlier perspectives, considered to be inextricably embedded in this sacred world, indeed to be an integral part of it. These ancient viewpoints are not _beliefs_ as we now understand the term but are representative of a living experience. They lie deep within the epistemology — the way people see reality — of all older cultures. Their components are remarkably similar in all cultures. """
"Yeah, it’s pretty great! Oh, forget about horoscopes. :smile:  Astrology is a very difficult science, and can only be learned from an adept. But suffice to say, the planetary energies does affect one’s propensities toward certain things. Vedic astrology is your best bet, but it’s not something I’d spend too much time on. Spend more time awakening yourself. The rest of the knowledge comes by itself, or you’ll just happen to find the right places where you’ll learn it proper."
<@U0F1ZMA72> Anything in particular that interested you?
"After a brief discussion with <@U0KL1MXC5> about a critique about meditation, which, if understood correctly was something along the lines of: “Meditation is about inhibiting thoughts, but if we don’t integrate the dark sides of ourselves, we’ll become less human, less our whole selves and more of a fake positive image of ourselves” (Abed, if you can find the article/link to the guy, I’d appreciate that.) 

To answer the critique, it is important to understand that this author/critic has fundamentally _misunderstood_ the process of meditation. This is not surprising since most common meditators and Yoga practitioners have completely misinterpreted the teachings. Therefore it’s paramount to understand this, even before one begins meditating. 

1. Meditation is _not_ about *suppressing* thoughts! When one is doing breathing meditation, and pays attention to the breath, one should _not_ disregard other things that come to mind. As they appear, one should realize that the same “knowing nature” is observing these things as they come and go in front of the awareness. 

2. The second mistake is to sit in torpor (a form of laziness of the mind), losing mindfulness (the strength of the “knowing nature”) and one follows the thought wherever it goes, as if one has fallen asleep, later to snap awake. 

In both of these ways, one has fallen prey to torpor (<http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/the-five-hindrances-handouts/the-hindrance-of-sloth-and-torpor/>) and one is not free of the five hindrances culminating in the warm bliss of present _radiant awareness_."
Indeed I did. I especially liked the mystical explanation behind Adam and Eve.
"The increased wakefulness can be explained by the gradual cleansing of the nadis and purifications of the skandhas. As Yang Chi (kundalini) rises, great bliss and wakefulness arises, even allowing the person to go with minimal sleep. This couples very well with sexual restraint, as the jing can then repair itself."
"Awakening is not a metaphor: the effects of Buddhist meditation practices on basic wakefulness: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4054695/>

Just incredible benefits found everywhere. Quoting from the abstract: *The course of meditative progress suggests a nonlinear multiphasic trajectory such that early phases that are more effortful may produce more fatigue and sleep propensity, while later stages produce greater wakefulness as a result of neuroplastic changes and more efficient processing.*"
"Just more benefits stuff: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24292324>

""We have previously hypothesized that the reason why physical activity increases precursor cell proliferation in adult neurogenesis is that movement serves as non-specific signal to evoke the alertness required to meet cognitive demands. Thereby a pool of immature neurons is generated that are potentially recruitable by subsequent cognitive stimuli. Along these lines, we here tested whether auditory stimuli might exert a similar non-specific effect on adult neurogenesis in mice. We used the standard noise level in the animal facility as baseline and compared this condition to white noise, pup calls, and silence. In addition, as patterned auditory stimulus without ethological relevance to mice we used piano music by Mozart (KV 448). All stimuli were transposed to the frequency range of C57BL/6 and hearing was objectified with acoustic evoked potentials. We found that except for white noise all stimuli, including silence, increased precursor cell proliferation (assessed 24 h after labeling with bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU). This could be explained by significant increases in BrdU-labeled Sox2-positive cells (type-1/2a). But after 7 days, only silence remained associated with increased numbers of BrdU-labeled cells. Compared to controls at this stage, exposure to silence had generated significantly increased numbers of BrdU/NeuN-labeled neurons.  _Our results indicate that the unnatural absence of auditory input as well as spectrotemporally rich albeit ethological irrelevant stimuli activate precursor cells-in the case of silence also leading to greater numbers of newborn immature neurons-whereas ambient and unstructured background auditory stimuli do not_“

TL:DR: “Silence is better than auditory input for the growth of new brain cels."""
"As Lao Tzu said, so elegantly, 

“If there is right in the soul, 
There will be beauty in the person, 
If there is beauty in the person, 
There will be harmony in the person, 
If there is harmony in the home, 
There will be order in the nation, 
If there is order in the nation,
There will be peace in the world.”

"*Myths of meditation*

_Is meditation selfish?_

It certainly looks that way. There sits the meditator parked on his little cushion. Is he out giving blood? No. Is he busy working with disaster victims? No. But let us examine his motivation. Why is he doing this? His intention is to purge his own of anger, prejudice and ill-will. He is actively engaged in the process of getting rid of greed, tension and insensitivity. Those are the very items which obstruct his compassion for others. 

Until they are gone, any good works that he does are likely to be just an extension of his own ego and of no real help in the long run. Harm in the name of help is one of the oldest games. The grand inquistor of the Spanish Inquistion spouts the lofties of motives. The Salem witchcraft trials were conducted for the public good. Examine the personal lives of advanced meditators and you will often find them engaged in humaniatiran service. You will seldom find them as crusading missionaries who are willing to sacrifice certain individuals for the sake of some pious idea. The fact is we are more selfish than we know. The ego has a way of turning the lofties of activites into trash if it is allowed free range. Through meditation we become aware of ourselves exactly as we are, by waking up to the numerous subtle ways that we manifest our own selfishness. Then we truly begin to be genuinely selfless. Cleansing yourself of selfishness is not a selfish activity. 

_Meditation is running away from reality_

Incorrect. Meditation is running into reality. It does not insulate you from the pain of life. It allows you to delve so deeply into life and all its aspects that you pierce the pain barrier and you go beyond suffering. Vipassana is a practice done with the specific intention of facing reality, to fully experience life just as it is and to cope with exactly what you find. It allows you to blow aside the illusions and to free yourself from all those polite little lies you tell yourself all the time. What is there is there. You are who you are, and lying to yourself about your own weaknesses and motivations only binds you tighter on the wheel of illusion. Vipassana meditation is not an attempt to forget yourself or cover up your troubles. It is learning to look at yourself exactly as you are. See what is there, accept it fully. Only then can you change it.

"Wanting to inspire everyone to get started, I will provide an excerpt from a book called _The Eureka Factor_, which is all about creativity: 

&gt;_A very experienced Zen meditator once contacted John to ask to have his EEG recorded and compared with the EEGs of average nonmeditators. The idea was to demonstrate to his students the effects of long-term meditation. Curious to see if there was a difference, John agreed. After his EEG was recorded—and yes, his brain activity was unusual—the meditator asked about the lab’s research. John told him about our work on the neural basis of insight, and he was intrigued. There was some time left in the session, so John asked him if he wanted to do a series of remote associates problems. He enthusiastically agreed. John was sure that the meditator would blow these problems away. After all, he had a superbly honed mind and a doctorate to boot. However, after he attempted about a dozen problems, it looked like he was going to tank. He timed out on puzzle after puzzle without solving a single one. After watching a couple of dozen painful failures, John was about to stop the session to spare the Zen meditator further embarrassment. But then he got one right. And then another and another. From that point on, he got nearly all of them right. This was unprecedented. Over the years, we have tested hundreds of participants and found no evidence that practice during a single session improves performance on remote associates problems. Nevertheless, the Zen meditator showed an amazing—and very sudden—improvement in his performance. This was an informal observation rather than a formal experiment, so we can’t offer a definitive explanation for the meditator’s turnaround. We do, however, have an educated hypothesis. Years of intensive meditation may have granted our Zen subject with hyper-refined attention. His mind was so still, focused, and concentrated that associations didn’t spontaneously pop into his awareness. However, his years of mental training also afforded him a great deal of self-control. Failing to solve these problems within his regular state of mind, he had the ability to try out different ways of allocating his attention until he hit on the broad focus that optimized his performance. Once he found the right spread of attention, his superior self-control allowed him to maintain it consistently, resulting in outstanding performance._

"I first considered delving into more advanced aspects of the self-realization process, but then realized, perhaps for many of you, it will simply be a bunch of words. That is often the case when it comes to that sort of thing. Without practical experience, all those words and descriptions will always just be like a finger pointing to the moon, but never the moon itself. _C’est ne pas un pipe_. 

Therefore, I think the best thing to move this forward, is simply to introduce a beginner technique. I’ve written this sort of beginner guide to several people — so please do try it out, if just for 5 minutes every day (though I recommend at least 10-30 minutes daily) for a week, and come back and tell me how it went or how it was terrible and there’s no point to it all! Any sort of feedback is appreciated. 

There are many different techniques of meditation one can use, but they all come down to one thing: _stilling_ the mind. What does stilling the mind mean exactly? 

Well, consider a glass of muddy water. When you first look at this water, you’ll think, well… this is not going anywhere — but as you continue watching, the mud slowly descends to the ground in the glass, and what’s left? A clear glass of water. In this metaphor, your thoughts and emotional turmoil is like all this mud. By just watching this mud for extended periods of time, in complete silence, the mud starts to clear out, and we’re left with what’s called by the Taoists _10000 miles of clear sky_, a state of utterly clear awareness where we are fully present and alive, blissful in the moment. Please keep this metaphor in mind when you meditate. 

So, when you are new to meditation, you simply need to work on calming your mind, which involves developing a one-pointed attention and relaxation. I suggest you start with 10 minutes, but at least twice daily (if you are to see significant results). Slowly increase the length to 12, then 14, then 16 minutes and so forth. You are not actually meditating at that point, but simply improving your capacity to do so. 

During this period of time, do your best focusing on the breath. How does one focus on the breath? One simply notes internally that the breath is moving in, it stops for a while, then it moves out, stops for a while, then moves in again. By continuously focusing on the breath (being aware of it), the thoughts will rest and eventually settle. The mind becomes more clear, and that's the point where true meditation begins. 

Frustration has no place in meditation practice, so you should always treat your mind with calmness. When you are distracted away from the breath, remember that you cannot remove thoughts. Just witness them and realize your distraction and move your awareness back to the breath. Tell your mind “thank you for letting me know of my distraction, so that I may return to the breath.” The thoughts will fade away naturally. 

Some people misunderstand how to focus or be aware of the breath and think that they ought to struggle. This is not the case. A metaphor that helps here is like holding jelly in your hand. Do not squish too tight, lest it is lost. Do not hold too freely either, because then it is also lost. Attend to the breath like you attend to a loved one. 

Consider that, after all, your breath keeps you alive. Ought you not to appreciate it fully with attention? When you realize the profundity of the breath, it helps with the awareness and one-pointed attention on it. 

This is one of the greatest beginner techniques for developing a calm mind, and was recommend by Siddharta Gautama as a method that can bring one directly toward enlightenment, through all 8 samadhis by correctly following the breath — so do not think it is not an advanced technique: in some of the most simplest of solutions, the most advanced of experiences can be attained. 

Best of luck. Please report back if you do go ahead and try it. As we move along in time, I will share more."

"To start off with, those that may not know much about meditation, let's distill it into its main components and talk a bit about it. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to post them here. I am here sharing the most rudimentary about meditation to stir conversation. 

Meditation is the Art and Science of training the mind. It is the systematic process of training the mind that allows people to experience great benefits. A regular sitting practice has been shown, scientifically mind you, to enhance focus and concentration, lower blood pressure, improve sleep quality. It’s been used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Meditation allows the practictioner to gain insight into their personalities, relationships, behaviors, and makes it easier to reverse past conditioning by increasing overall awareness and sensitivity. The enhanced awareness is enormously helpful in work and personal relationships, as it adds depth to one’s interactions with others. The emotional stability that comes from the calming and relaxation effects of meditation need also be mentioned. All of these effects, however, are just side-benefits, or if you will, side-effects of meditation. 

Fully developed meditational ability gives rise to increasingly wonderful sensations and mental states characterized by deep mental and physical relaxation, inner joy, peace, happiness and profound inner peace. These are states that open the mind to an intuitive grasp of the interconnectedness of all that is and dispels the illusion of separateness told and created by the ego. 

However, even those peak states of meditation are not the ultimate goal or benefit from meditation. While bliss, joy and tranquility are all very real and enticing, it can often be interrupted by sickness, difficult life circumstances and other influences. It also offers no protection from the difficulties of averting the draw toward lust, greed, aversion and sloth. They are simply a means to a higher goal. That goal, of course, is _awakening_. 

Instead of awakening, words one might use can be, _self-realization_ and _enlightenment_ . Each of these words simply refers to a cognitive event that brings lasting freedom from suffering where one is unaffected by aging, disease or mere circumstance. It is not some transient experience of divine unity and dissolution of the ego. No, rather, it’s the attainment of true genuine wisdom (by the traditions called prajna wisdom) that comes from profound realization and opening one’s eyes to the ultimate truth, which is the the only true and worthy goal of any spiritual tradition. 

A mind with this type of prajna wisdom experiences life and death as a great adventure, with the clear purpose of manifesting compassion, peace, and love toward all beings."
"Welcome everyone. I hope this channel can be a shared platform for communicating ideas and thoughts regarding the events that surround the concept of awakening, namely that of deconditioning the mind from past ""negative"" programming allowing it to operate at peak states of consciousness, by some called being in the _flow_, by the more spiritual traditions called _jhãna_ and _samadhis_, which are deep absorptive states of consciousness, marked by an extremely heightened awareness and improved cognitive functioning. May we all strive well to achieve the goal of not only improving our mind's abilities to stay more present and be more blissful in our daily lives, but also awakening the latent abilities that are part of our true humanity."
