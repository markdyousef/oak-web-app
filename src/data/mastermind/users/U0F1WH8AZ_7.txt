<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Analects-Classics-Confucius/dp/0140443487/>

&gt;The Analects express a philosophy, or a moral code, by which Confucius, one of the most humane thinkers of all time, believed everyone should live. Upholding the ideals of wisdom, self-knowledge, courage and love of one's fellow man, he argued that the pursuit of virtue should be every individual's supreme goal. And, while following the Way, or the truth, might not result in immediate or material gain, Confucius showed that it could nevertheless bring its own powerful and lasting spiritual rewards."
"_In his book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, Zen master Shunryu Suzuki approaches the question of fast and slow learners in terms of horses. ""In our scrip- tures, it is said that there are four kinds of horses: excellent ones, good ones, poor ones, and bad ones. The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will, before it sees the shadow of the whip; the second best will run as well as the first one, just before the whip reaches its skin; the third one will run when it feels pain on its body; the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn to run._

_""When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. But this is a mistake"", Master Suzuki says. When you learn too easily, you're tempted not to work hard, not to penetrate to the marrow of a practice._

_""If you study calligraphy, you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art, and in life."" The best horse, according to Suzuki, may be the worst horse. And the worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever it is practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones._

_""Suzuki's parable of the four horses has haunted me ever since I first heard it. For one thing, it poses a clear challenge for the person with exceptional tal- ent: to achieve his or her full potential, this person will have to work just as diligently as those with less innate ability”_

"You’d be surprised how addicting it is. Instant cognitive stimulation, fast enough to induce a stress response, while good enough at it to induce activity in one’s reward center. Damned be those games! :grin: :smile:"
"For those internet addicts such as myself - quick chess, Reddit, what-have-you, I've found great benefit from the Mac application called SelfControl. It blocks a list of websites for a designated block of time. It's also quite resilient as you can close the app, restart the computer and so forth, but it's still blocking internet access to those pages. Quite helpful for me. :simple_smile:"
"That’s awesome. I’ve been using ToDoist, and I’ve tried Wunderlist in the past — but it looks like they’ve revamped their layout. Looks much better now. I might make the switch and give it a shot!  Never heard of Trello before. Looks very interesting!"
"Confucius said, 

&gt;“In order to cultivate themselves, people must first rectify their own hearts and minds. Wishing to rectify their hearts and minds, they must first seek to practice sincerity. Wishing to practice sincerity, they must first extend to the utmost their knowledge, which involves the investigation of things to their roots. By gaining insight into the nature of things, wisdom becomes complete and you realize the highest good. In apprehending the highest good, you can manifest sincerity. By manifesting sincerity, you rectify your heart and mind. By rectifying your heart and mind, you cultivate yourself. By cultivating yourself, you thereby guide your family. From guiding your family, you establish moral order in your community and states and by establishing moral order in your state you bring peace and prosperity to the whole country.”"
"I'll begin with an open-question which I hope will prompt all kinds of responses: *What GTD system are you using? *

For those that are not aware, GTD = Getting Things Done. In other words, what (if any) do you use to keep track of the tasks you need to do on a daily basis and generally organizing your work flow? If you use certain apps, which do you use? If you use pen and paper, how do you do it? And so forth. 

Basically please share any tips and tricks to getting things done that you’ve encountered or you are currently using with success, or even without success, so we may learn from our mistakes :simple_smile:"
