"<@U0F1ZMA72>:  What if you could rent out CPU power and storage during the night, when you don't use your devices and get paid for it, would you do it? Every person in the west has on average 2,4 connected actively connected devices. These devices aren't actively used during night, but often still connected. If we could utilise different time zones, the rapid growth of technology both in terms of bandwidth, computation power, etc. And the inclination towards shared economy we could build a distributed cloud network. A peer to peer system consisting of nodes in a network running programs that scale horizontally using existing but unused infrastructure. And the user is even getting paid for it. This could truly be the utilisation of technology. Is it possible <@U0F1V9D9A> <@U0F570U57> <@U0F23JM99> Airbnb for computation power :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 

I like the idea of utilizing excess/un-used technology as well as Airbnb and newly started danish startup SpaceFlex, which is a peer-to-peer platform offering people to ""rent"" XX sqm for storage (basically Boxit in a peer-to-peer disguise). I truly believe that just as you can create a marketplace for excess of physical space you can do the exact same in more intangible areas. As long as the incentives are clear like the financial incentives you mentioned <@U0F1ZMA72>, then I believe the potential is huge - no doubt.  

Are you thinking of an IoT network platform with smart nodes and nothing else - no third parties? Time zones as the determinator for availability (no. of online/offline audience)? How exactly would you picture the setup of that peer-to-peer platform?"
