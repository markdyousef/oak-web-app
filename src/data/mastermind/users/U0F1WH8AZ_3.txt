"It references a fantastic movie called Mr. Nobody. It’s pretty long, but it’s a fascinating tale, and really well made."
Oh right! Please post it there then. :smile:
"And thanks for the answer. Sounds interesting. But still rather nonsensical for someone who hasn’t worked with node.js, AWS, Lambda or EB :stuck_out_tongue:"
What is AWS? Amazon Web Services?
That's cool! What backend stuff will you be doing? 
High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)
"Absolutely <@U0F1ZMA72> and indeed, Napolean Hill actually directly emphasizes brahmachayara, sexual retention. Tesla was celibate since his late 20s as he cultivated the deep samadhis and knew that the sexual essence is important for the cultivation of mental and physical well-being. For males that do not meditate, the essence is not as important, and having ejaculation between 4-7 times per week is okay according to the Taoists, but if you meditate and use those energies inwardly, it is generally recommended to either abstain completely or do twice per month. It builds the internal repertoire of power. Godspeed gentlemen. "
"<!channel> I really liked this post on goal-setting. I hope you others may find it helpful as well for whatever your goals may be: <https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/33jijb/method_a_goalsetting_fix_that_will_transform_your/>

I usually keep mental tabs on my goals, but I will begin writing them down daily in the manner expressed. It may give a bit more oomph to the transformation. Obsession used productively is a great thing. 

In NLP and spiritual transformational systems, we use something similar that’s called auto-suggestion. Before sleep, every night, you choose a particular idea you would like to impress upon your unconscious systems. It could, “I am healthy”, or “I am happy”, or “I accomplish my goals”, and you repeat that phrase 40 repetitions at least before you fall asleep. You do this every night, and when you wake up in the morning, you start your day with that. As you find the impregnation being succesful, you can then change it to something else, but give it at least a month or so for obvious changes to occur. This goes very well with meditation because it allows the link between conscious and unconscious mind to increase. More energy will be readily available. If you have questions regarding auto-suggestion, don’t hesitate to ask. I will make a full post on it, should it be wanted/desired."
"@soufyan Ah right! My bad. Well, I hope you'll get some energy influx soon in whatever way :p A lot of tea helps me through the winter. "
"<@U0F570U57>: The influx of energy wouldn’t be before Spring according to what is written above :sun_with_face: Even in Spain, it’s still Winter. :simple_smile:"
I'm free tomorrow night. 
"Sounds good, Mark. To quote my spiritual teacher, it is usually a bad time at year to make resolutions. But for others, it may suffice, but I’ll post this here, since you mentioned it, and may find it interesting.  _“The winter, being a time of barrenness for nature, is not an ideal time for new resolutions, and truly, people rarely keep to them. The spring is when the earth receives its new influx of energy from the sun, and this equinox is the ideal time to bring in the new year with spiritual celebration and inspiration. Specifically, it is a time marked by a certain phase of the moon following the spring equinox, for all magical calendars must take into account both the sun and the moon. All four seasonal intervals are a good time for fire rituals: the fire rituals in winter are to support the kalva (time of retreat) and the burning of obstacles, and the fire ritual of the spring equinox is to support the prayers and new years resolutions made on that day, similar to how old traditions might sacrifice an animal before a grand voyage”_"
Goal for this life-time: Reaching enlightenment. Will you keep me accountable <@U0F1ZMA72>? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Excellent. Looking forward. :ok_hand:
