"Really interesting topic <@U0F21G8VD>. I remember a start-up company that I worked with a couple of months ago (spinoff from Danfoss). They worked with EAP (Electroactive Polymers).. now, if I remember correct one of the many possible applications for their technology was harvesting kinetic energy from humans etc. However, their main focus was to measure pulling, shocks, twists etc. Their website: <http://leaptechnology.com/technology/>. Another thing I came across on my simple google search was this article, which had an interesting sketch of a possible energy harvesting application in shoes: <http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles-archive/3749-a-scalable-solution-to-harvest-kinetic-energy>"

"It is obvious to see the endless possibilities VR can offer.. I guess the technology can be applied to pretty much every aspect of our constructed society. 
I like how this idea of VR painting utilizes the technology and could ask the question: Should/could future exhibitions be in VR format.. yes, I guess so. And how cool is that?

This is pretty damn cool. Talking about exploiting air with high levels of humidity? <http://www.techinsider.io/the-fontus-self-filling-water-bottle-2016-1>
