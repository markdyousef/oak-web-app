Ohhh that's the movie!! I really wanted to figure out. Thanks! :ok_hand:

<@U0F21G8VD>: <@U0F1V9D9A> does tomorrow fit your  schedule? 
"From my experience. Saying one's goals out loud to someone who will keep you accountable is also really helpful for pushing one towards realising such goals. Today I told my boss, that I'll be able to handle the majority of our backend-development (a developer type we are looking for) in 3-4 months self education. It's an awesome a über challenging task :sweat_smile: hopefully <@U0F1V9D9A> will helt me out and we'll be able to build some cool stuff together. "
"I relation to Anders' description of auto-suggestion and the post' emphasis on goal-setting and obsession. I would recommend everyone to read 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napolean Hill (this is one of the books I recommended to you <@U0F21G8VD>).

It's a practical guide to unleashing the law of attraction - a universal law just as gravity, electromagnetism... It's a must read! "

For myself, 2016 will be the year where I continue my improvement towards becoming the best me. Why? Simply because the odds of improving the world is better if  I myself am better. For me, this improvement comes from diving further into the spiritual realm of the universe to experience, comprehend and understand things as they truly are, but may be cluttered due to societal influence and a limited mind. It comes from dedication and hard work towards improving crafts as electrical engineering, data science and software engineering, which I believe can help facilitate solutions to big problems. And it comes from strengthening and pushing the fleshly vessel I call my body to greater extends..."
Of course I’ll keep you accountable anderskassem! :simple_smile:
