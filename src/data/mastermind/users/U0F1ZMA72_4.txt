I’m kinda pissed to be honest! That organizations we trust to anchor humanity in the right direction are withholding such lethal information.
"Just watched the Cowspiracy doc. If the numbers are right, then that’s a freaking huge issue!! And not something a sexy Tesla or technological gadget can safe us from :disappointed: We need to change supply or demand (or both) dramatically!"
"I believe incentives like this, vertical farming, GE seeds and plants, cultured meat(in-vitro meat) is the future of the human food-chain in large. A little weird saying, coming from a guy who supports organic produce and meat. "
<@U0F1V9D9A>: you better learn to eat fish :joy:
"In relation to Anders' post about the problem with agriculture and its carbon emission. I don't agree with a vegan diet (might change my view), since I think there is a far better alternative - The case for fish farming

Hahahaha that’s awesome!! :sweat_smile:
Hahahaha!!! Sounds awesome :joy:
"<@U0F1WH8AZ>: Do you have any studies regarding sleep? I’ve thought about experimenting with things such as uberman, siesta, etc. What is the bare minimum for functioning? In laymen terms, I know the brain goes through a process where it cleanses itself from toxins during sleep (particular REM sleep if I remember correctly). I’ve tried varies of hacks to optimize, but I would prefer a concrete evidence-based standpoint :simple_smile:"
Awesome to see you guys interacting and sharing knowledge!
Great experience for finding nutritional facts: <https://sageproject.com/>
"I’ve only tried Aniracetam and Noopept. I’ve recently cycled  one of the compounds with CDP-choline for two weeks straight and then one week off. Initially, it had a great impact on my cognitive work, but i seems that I’ve grown pretty tolerant to it."
<@U0F1WH8AZ>: What are your thoughts on this? Hacking the nervous system - inflammation in body tissues are being directly regulated by the brain: <http://mosaicscience.com/story/hacking-nervous-system>
"I’ve personally found that cutting lactose (disaccharide sugar) and gluten (storage protein) from my diet has made wast improvements in my overall health. Adapting a paleo / ketogenic diet has given me a lot more energy, cognitive improvements, etc. by reducing the toxins I put into my body. Here’s a list of supplements that I’m currently taking. There are a few stables, but I’m really trying to listen to my body and mind towards what works and what doesn’t work in different periods of my life. 
•Creatine (Muscle creatine content, power output, hydration)
•BCAAs (Aerobic exercise, fat oxidation)
•Ginseng (anti-fatigue effects, subjective wellbeing, decrease in blood glucose)
•Ginkgo Bilopa (reducing risk of cognitive decline, increase in short term memory)
•Vitamin D (reducing risk of falls, increase testosterone, subjective health)
•Krill Oil, Omega 3 ( reduces stress, C-Reactive protein, blood pressure, depression and increases HDL-C and more)
•Vitamin B complex ( maintain nerves, regeneration of cells, protect against atherosclerosis)
•Turmeric - (anti-inflamatory, increase in antioxidant capacity…)
•L-Theanine - (reducing stress, anxiety, and improving focus and sleep quality)
•Multivitamin - (general health benefits)
•Magnesium - (assist in ATP production)
•Vitamin C - ( increase glutathione - powerful antioxidant)
•Spirulina - (Alkalyzing, reducing allergies)
•Ketones/ MCT - (increase midrocomdia function in the brain, processing speed, metabolic rate, working memory)
•Racetam  - (Increases oxygen levels in the brain and communication between left and right side of the brain. Also protects the brain from certain toxins and low oxygen levels)
•Huperzine A or CDP-choline - (modifying level of neurotransmitters, increase attention, memory, choline levels in the brain"
