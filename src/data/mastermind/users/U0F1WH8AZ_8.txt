"Too bad these billionaires don’t realize the _genuine_ spiritual path for what it is: designed for one purpose and one purpose only: breaking you out, _awakening_, ending all suffering. Eventually they’ll have to come to grips with the fact that materialism is metaphysically incongruent."
"I completely agree. There’s definitely need for innovation in this area on how to provide something similar to proper quality control for journals. Unfortunately, there’s currently the need for prestige, and often, the prestige then attracts the best scientists to the editorial boards of various journals. Hopefully, one can think out a system with time, that can maintain the high standard of publication."
"I’m very happy to see something like this happening. I agree, science should be free for all. To those that don’t know, it’s not even scientists that are getting the cut, it’s the publishing companies. Very nice article."

"Fascinating point, Mark. 

I do agree with your overall view. 

I honestly don’t have an answer in regards to the spiritual planes. It depends on whether it could make astral and etheric bodies, and that would depend on some form of consciousness higher up the hierarchy. I don’t exactly understand how technology would interface with the spiritual realms. As far as I understood, our human bodies are created from the divine template, and therefore have etheric and astral bodies which allow the interface between the dimensions. The entire universe is expressed in our body. This is what’s known as the macrocosm exists in the microcosm. Whether that would be the case for a technological entity, I honestly don’t know. I really doubt it, since it would be constrained by the physical laws that rule it — but then again, if, as you said it is not constrained because it’s self-evolving, then… god knows. It may be able to figure out the cosmic/metaphysical laws that exist on the spiritual planes, and then use that to its advantage. It would become an intense egregore, that’s for sure. 

It’s very interesting to think about."
"It’s a good question. 

I don’t know of enough specifics or have delved enough into the subject matter, to really discuss whether it is a foreseeable consequence of AI technology that it would evolve to such a degree that we are not capable of controlling it. 

What frightens me currently more is that it appears that as soon as great technologies are created and great knowledge has been found, there will always be people that want to use that power for something nefarious. 

We can see this all over the world today. We have so much technological and scientific knowledge to solve so many problems in today’s society, yet the Military Industrial complex is fueling a War Machine that is profiteering from wars instigated throughout the world.  

So my question will simply be. Will it be worth it creating such a technology and then letting it get into the wrong hands? Because surely, it is a matter of resources. And if anything, an AI would certainly help with geopolitical issues of accruing more resources and detailing planned invasions taking into account all kinds of data that human beings wouldn’t be as capabale of. It would be _the_ greatest weapon for attaining power — at least in theory. 

Unfortunately, there’s no safe-line for human ego and ignorance. There are certain currents that is helping us move a certain direction, but that same current is also causing upheavals, as it forces people to make choices based on fear or love. Do we stand together, or do we stand alone and fight whomeever may come and, from our perspective, threaten us? 

You can observe this just after the Paris Attacks. People are immediately retaliating. That’s not a choice from wisdom, it’s a choice made from ignorance. 

Does a child that has hit another child with a stick in the playground, go get another stick and then goes around hitting everyone with it? No, you remove the stick and you found out who sold that stick to begin with, and stop that. 

Solve the cause, not the symptoms. 

I could of course be completely wrong, and an AI may solve all our problems. I just don’t see that scenario as very likely.  :simple_smile:"
