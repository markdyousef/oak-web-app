"Hi guys. Thank you for the kind words Mark. For those of you who do not know me, my background, passion etc.:  My educational track record so far counts a bachelor's degree from Copenhagen Business School including an exchange period in South East Asia. I am planning to pursuit a master's degree - still within business administration - however, I may spice it up with Business IT or similar. I have an entrepreneurial mind-set, keen interest in business, and technology.. however,  with that being said I am also curious by nature hence my eagerness to constantly challenge myself by broadening my scope and learning about other things as well - whether that is online, in a caf√© in downtown Odense or on an island in the Far East does not really matter to me - as I think the entire world should be our playground. I work as an Associate Consultant with the consultancy ETEQ Venture, assisting tech SMEs and startups in their pursuit for funding as well as matching them with industrial partners - basically a melting pot of all my interests. I look forward to learn from all the masterminds and engage in rich discussions about.. well... anything. :simple_smile:"
