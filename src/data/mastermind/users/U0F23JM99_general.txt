"Greetings, masterminds!

I would like to start my presentation  by sincerely apologizing for my lack of participation. I had devoted  my resources to a thesis, which I had to finish by this day. 

The latter leads me to a presentation of my occupation.  Currently,  I am studying BSc in International Business at Copenhagen Business School. In short, International Business is a hyped program, full of diligent people, that does not live up to its reputation. I am therefore looking for challenging opportunities to complement my study. 

I have always been an ambitious perfectionist, which is both a valuable strength and a destructive weakness. However, I consistently seek to maximize the benefits of it by focusing on endeavours that contributes favourably to the development of my competencies.

However, I have not realized my genuine passions yet. Despite my curiosity, I have not found the things that keep me up at night and wake me up in the morning. Interacting with you guys is therefore extremely rewarding."

That's so cool! So liberating to see that there are still people out there daring to pursue their personal objectives :pray::skin-tone-3:
