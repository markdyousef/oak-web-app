"Oh yes Statins.. Thanks a lot Anders, I'll PM you his report right away."
"<@U0F1WH8AZ>: <@U0F1ZMA72> Hey guys. I have a question regarding the health of my father. He apparently has high cholesterol and have been prescribed some ''Medicine'', which he is supposed to take as long it is a problem. Now my opinion on how this works is, that he is being tricked into getting addicted to some drug, which probably has more negative effects than positive. All for the profit of the pharmaceutical companies. He's very active man, which Mark knows and I'm almost a 100% sure, that there is a better solution of him eating a different way to solve his problem. He's told to cut down on high fat foods and is even afraid of eating avocado now. I'd like to know your opinion on this problem. By the way I've his laboratory report if you'd like to see."
