"<@U0F1ZMA72>: I mostly use classical and bayesian. Still didn't use tenser flow, because it's a lot of blackbox stuff. Kind of sucks to wright a paper and the method used is a blackbox. But I have to admit, the blackbox algorithms work better than all the other stuff."
"<@U0F1ZMA72>: Haha I thought I would only have the python 3.x discussion at work , but even you're asking me haha, No I haven't yet. Still using 2"
"To be honest I think it is not the technology that we should be scared of, but we should be scared of ourselves. There's no limit to what we can do and let technology do for us. So I totally agree with <@U0F1WH8AZ>."
"Haha I know. I'm sorry I forgot to mention that.. But there's another package manager that works together with pip called anaconda. 
haha I remember fighting with pip to get all the data science related modules installed on my laptop without anaconda. Try this: <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>"
"<@U0F1ZMA72>: The udacity course (<https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120>) on machine learning is a good introductory, where (ofcourse) Python is used as the programming language. I also recommend to use Python instead of R for data science, not because R is ""bad"", but because Python  can be used in other fields (Web Dev, games, API programming etc.) in contrast to R. All three languages mentioned here have helpful communities. In my opinion Python better than most language because it has the sklearn module <http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable/index.html> that contains all the algos used in ML. 
The thing with Machine Learning is that you want to apply the models they teach you as soon as possible on ""real"" data (e.g. movie reviews, try the UCI repository for data <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html>), else the models may become a bit too abstract. I read the book by Peter Flach: ""Machine Learning: The art and science of algorithms  that make sense of data"", this book actually needs a lecturer because there's no application of the algorithms. Therefore,  I also did some excercises of the book: ""Building Machine Learning systems with Python"". Usually, in Machine Learning the big distinction is supervised/unsupervised learning and feature extraction which will get you very far. Once you grasp those concepts in all their glory, you can move on to deep learning and factorisation."
