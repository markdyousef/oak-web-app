"Datamatiker is the one I have, so probably more relevant to try web developers .. it is also a superstructure Computer Science. SDU has nothing to do with the training to do :)"
"Budget (free) labor, hopefully some developer candidates and an opportunity to give something back"

"&lt;@ U321CN2N7&gt; Strive to have some ideas ready for a possible PM tool on Thursday - here we will of course also go into more detail on what we need. The purpose is not to add a new tool to our pipeline, but a framework to organize themselves so that everyone is updated and streamlining workflows. Pt. we Trello, Slack and Google Drive, none of which require more re-working process. About the solution just is attributing such a existing or add a new tool, we must try us forward. But attempts to embedded to some of the agile principles you from the study and answer the questions you asked about, as late as yesterday: &#39;how far is&#39;? Is there a way where YOU could always have a touch of this? Just not Jira something with too much overhead, so I am broadly care what we use: joy:"

"Hey guys! Had a very good talk with Mark New Year&#39;s Eve relation. &#39;Expectations in 2017. We talked about some thoughts I have recently done me. I sit in the middle of a 2-month examination period which takes all my time and focus. Can mark on my body that it&#39;s starting to get a little additional stress that I have both studio and having to start a project from scratch running at the same time. At the same time, I also know that about five months, I am left in an exam period which makes me feel out of service, followed by a half year internship. Therefore made up my mind that I either focus 100% on the studio or 100% of the project. Skewed I can not get to work and a lack of commitment is the last thing I want to be known for. I choose to focus on the study and to complete it in style, so I can look back and be proud of my efforts. Something which unfortunately never happened during my bachelor. The time is just not right for me right now, but am sure we meet when. And by that time I hope there are more sit / stand tables. Struggling with major back problems. Sincerely hope that the sheep created a fucking awesome revolutionary product!"

"Yes it so I know. We must just look different through tomorrow. I am not indeed impressed by Asana. Super delicious UI etc. but feel a little Slack trumps the communication part, and Trello on integrations"

"We can do that, but I can not help give an estimate before tonight .. And it sounds like a rush job and we can not start before Wednesday .."
"No, but have a friend who does. Should we bid?"
Sounds not so extensive. A you know?
Preparations I am quite aware that you can prepare. But does not it rational to push a lot out on social media before you know what you look like ..?

"Specific! We also just be careful what we give of features and so on. So we do not end up in something with special servers to be certified, etc. :)"
Yes indeed. Reasonable technical industry with a lot of learning. But shut up it would be cool to shake a little of it!
