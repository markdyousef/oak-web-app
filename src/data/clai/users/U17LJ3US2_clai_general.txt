"&lt;@ U321CN2N7&gt; Strive to have some ideas ready for a possible PM tool on Thursday - here we will of course also go into more detail on what we need. The purpose is not to add a new tool to our pipeline, but a framework to organize themselves so that everyone is updated and streamlining workflows. Pt. we Trello, Slack and Google Drive, none of which require more re-working process. About the solution just is attributing such a existing or add a new tool, we must try us forward. But attempts to embedded to some of the agile principles you from the study and answer the questions you asked about, as late as yesterday: &#39;how far is&#39;? Is there a way where YOU could always have a touch of this? Just not Jira something with too much overhead, so I am broadly care what we use: joy:"

"Hey guys! Had a very good talk with Mark New Year&#39;s Eve relation. &#39;Expectations in 2017. We talked about some thoughts I have recently done me. I sit in the middle of a 2-month examination period which takes all my time and focus. Can mark on my body that it&#39;s starting to get a little additional stress that I have both studio and having to start a project from scratch running at the same time. At the same time, I also know that about five months, I am left in an exam period which makes me feel out of service, followed by a half year internship. Therefore made up my mind that I either focus 100% on the studio or 100% of the project. Skewed I can not get to work and a lack of commitment is the last thing I want to be known for. I choose to focus on the study and to complete it in style, so I can look back and be proud of my efforts. Something which unfortunately never happened during my bachelor. The time is just not right for me right now, but am sure we meet when. And by that time I hope there are more sit / stand tables. Struggling with major back problems. Sincerely hope that the sheep created a fucking awesome revolutionary product!"

"I talked straight with an old friend today. Before I joined Woerk, I was going to make a small app project to an RPG (paper, not live ..) they were making. So I had no time and forgot the little. Now it showed up again today and they&#39;re actually getting ready to have needed it. The problem is that they very likely can not pay us to do it, as they feed on the kick starter and donations for their animation film. The contrast respectively. 2,709 and 3,920 backere on their kickstarter, 7000 likes on facebook and 38,000 subscribers on youtube. Those will they like parts of .. I thought at first that it was a little Badun .. but the people they hit, I think is very much in the category as such. our guide app would be."
Yes exactly
So also like a talk from 2015 when it was called JAWS. Did not have to aws also actively helped to develop and improve it
No it does it probably will not: blush: have not had time to check Apex right out yet. Has been sitting with serverless and very confident - especially since it is based on lambda mm
Fun fact: There has not been a time in the day where we all three have stood up at the same time. : Trollface:
"It is backed by Facebook and aws, do not believe it just disappears .. Serverless vs apex that could apex good win, but not progress well"
What time was it tonight? And where we are met?
