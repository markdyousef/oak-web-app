Today, Neurala is joining this list thanks to a $14 million Series A led by Pelion&nbsp;Ventures. The team is&nbsp;looking to put AI in the hands of toy makers, drone enthusiasts and IoT engineers alike.\nNeurala&rsquo;s real value-proposition is its&nbsp;ability to execute machine learning frameworks, locally, with limited resources. The startup promises incremental learning so that devices, not connected to a network, can continue to learn and update after field deployment. For time-sensitive industries, being able to compute and train locally is critical.\n&ldquo;Large companies collecting tons of data like Google, Facebook and Uber hold an advantage to train on a specific data set,&rdquo; said Massimiliano Versace, CEO of Neurala.&rdquo;But using very high-end supercomputers to do lots of processing doesn&rsquo;t meet all the needs of the commercial market.&rdquo;\nVersace (yes, of relation to the&nbsp;fashion house Versace) is one of four co-founders at Neurala, all of whom share&nbsp;cognitive and neural systems Ph.D.s from Boston University.&nbsp;Their core&nbsp;product, the&nbsp;Neurala Brain, manifests itself as a fairly generalized out-of-the-box SDK offering called&nbsp;Brains for Bots. But, for the majority of customers, it should be enough.\nThe Neurala founding team\nTake Teal Drones as an example. Lacking a specialty in machine learning, the drone company&rsquo;s founder George Matus is using Neurala to power a &ldquo;follow-me&rdquo; feature on its speedy craft.&nbsp;Opting for a third-party solution over something in-house can help startups, without a core competency in machine learning, save R&amp;D money and get a product&nbsp;to market in a reasonable time.\nFor customers that need a bit more, Neurala offers a data ingestion service where it will train and finesse a model to serve a niche&nbsp;use case.\n&ldquo;There are customers who&nbsp;would need to&nbsp;send up a drone to monitor and inspect power lines and in real-time send back information&nbsp;based on the machine&nbsp;learning done on the drone,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Ben Lambert, senior associate at Pelion Ventures.\nFacebook and other large tech companies are exploring the idea of on-device local training. Style Transfer is a great example of pushing machine learning directly to devices to run in real-time, but the company still needed to complete initial training in-house. There are fundamental limits around compute power right now, but certain use cases with smaller amounts of data might not&nbsp;always require the server farm approach.\nNeurala is hardware agnostic, capable of scaling from low-end CPUs to high-end GPUs, and able to&nbsp;pull from a number of frameworks including Tensorflow. The Neurala SDK works with Linux, Android and iOS. And if your problem calls for it, the startup also offers a server-based solution.\nThis effectively means that Neurala has three separate business models. The server-based option complements the training service and traditional software license fee distribution model.\nIn addition to&nbsp;Pelion Ventures, Sherpa Capital, Motorola Ventures, 360 Capital Partners, Draper Associates Investments and Idinvest Partners are also participating in today&rsquo;s round.&nbsp;Motorola Ventures is particularly of note&nbsp;as Motorola Solutions is one of Neurala&rsquo;s early customers.","id":1,"fallback":"TechCrunch Link: Neurala closes $14M Series A to bring machine learning to the&nbsp;edge","thumb_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/neurala_autorecognition-08.jpg?fit=200%2C150&ssl=1","from_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/17\/neurala-closes-14m-series-a-to-bring-machine-learning-to-the-edge\/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&utm_content=FaceBook&sr_share=facebook"}],"1":null,"2":[{"title":"Emotion Analysis SDKs and APIs - Affectiva","service_name":"Affectiva","title_link":"http:\/\/www.affectiva.com\/solutions\/apis-sdks\/","text":"Affectiva's emotion analysis APIs and SDKs help developers create real-time, emotion-enabled applications, allowing digital experiences to come to life.","id":1,"fallback":"Affectiva: Emotion Analysis SDKs and APIs - Affectiva","service_icon":"http:\/\/www.affectiva.com\/favicon.ico","from_url":"http:\/\/www.affectiva.com\/solutions\/apis-sdks\/"}],"3":[{"thumb_height":256,"service_icon":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/favicon.ico","thumb_width":256,"title":"Science AMA Series: I'm Joanna Bryson, a Professor in Artificial (and Natural) Intelligence.
