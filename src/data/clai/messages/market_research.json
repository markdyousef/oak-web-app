The arena hosted the handball competition of the Summer Olympics a few years ago. But this weekend has been all about a different kind of competition &mdash; the Disrupt London Hackathon.\nSome of them were participating in our event for the first time, while others were regular hackers. Their challenge was to come up with a neat, funny and smart hack in just 24 hours.\nWe could all feel the excitement in the air when the 63 teams took the stage to present a short one-minute demo to impress fellow hackers and our judges. But only one team could take home the grand prize and &pound;4,000. So, without further ado, meet the Disrupt London 2016 Hackathon winner.\nWinner: The Emotion Journal\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nJournaling has proven psychological, stress-reducing, goal-orienting benefits when done regularly. But for many people, writing is harder than talking. The team used IBM Watson to create a smart voice journal. You talk to it about your day and it analyzes your emotions and stores the logs. If you do it once a day you can see a visual representation of your feelings and experiences over time. Using artificial intelligence to improve people&rsquo;s mental health is quite neat.\nTechCrunch&rsquo;s Kate Conger wrote an article about this hack because it&rsquo;s pretty cool.\nRunner-Up #1: Sayfe Space\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nRefugees suffer from distress and mental health conditions which are difficult to address without the support of friends and family or a mental wellness expert. Sayfe Space gives Refugees a platform to naturally describe their problems and get support by anonymously chatting with volunteers that can empathize with their situation and are keen to offer support. The team used IBM Watson for natural language processing and the chatbot interactions.\nRunner-Up #2: DoshBot\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nDoshbot is an AI assistant that helps you save money. It integrates and pulls in your banking transactions, GPS location and mix them with your emotional tones and writing style on social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook.\nHackathon Judges\nSaalim Chowdhury\nSaalim is a recovering serial founder and startup enthusiast, and has sought refuge at 500 Startups. There he&rsquo;s an Entrepreneur in Residence, where he finds startups to invest in primarily for the London Series A growth &amp; investment program and works with them specifically on Enterprise Sales, Customer Centricity and Applied Machine Learning.\nAn old-fashioned polymath, he&rsquo;s been a technical co-founder (CTO), a growth hacker (CMO) and led sales (CEO). Notable exits he&rsquo;s been involved with include consulting talent on demand company Skillbridge (acquired by Andreessen-backed unicorn Toptal) and internet security firm ScanSafe (acquired by Cisco).
